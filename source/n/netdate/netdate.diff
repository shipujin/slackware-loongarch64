+It is also useful to have a shell script, e.g., \fB/sbin/timehosts\fP,
 which contains a call on \fInetdate\fP with arguments appropriate
 to the local system, so that it is easy to set the time manually.

-\fIDcn\-gateway\fP is a hypothetical host which usually keeps time
+.SH "netdate -l 30 udp dcn\-gate tcp neighbor"
+\fIDcn\-gate\fP is a hypothetical host which usually keeps time
 accurate to within milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time,
 but may occasionally be eight hours off.
 \fINeighbor\fP is a neighbor of the local host which keeps time
 with moderate accuracy.
-The time will be set to that of \fIdcn\-gateway\fP if that and \fIneighbor\fP
+The time will be set to that of \fIdcn\-gate\fP if that and \fIneighbor\fP
 agree to within thirty seconds, else it will not be set at all.
 This is almost good enough for most circumstances, but won't do
 when the local host's time is known to be wrong (e.g., after
 a long downtime or a bad crash) and must be set to something.
 If one of the hosts named is inaccurate or not responding, there is a problem.
-.SH "netdate -l 30 udp dcn\-gateway tcp neighbor neighbor2"
+.SH "netdate -l 30 udp dcn\-gate tcp neighbor neighbor2"
 Only two of the three hosts named must agree on the time.
 The time will still be set (to that of the first neighbor),

+even if \fIdcn\-gate\fP is far off as long as the two neighbors agree.
 This is probably good enough for most cases.
 One can arbitrarily gerrymander the vote for more insurance
 (and less clarity), as in the following example.
-.SH "netdate\ udp\ dcn\-gateway\ dcn1\ tcp\ bbn\-unix\ localhost\ neighbor"
+.SH "netdate\ udp\ dcn\-gate\ dcn1\ tcp\ bbn\-unix\ localhost\ neighbor"
 Here \fIdcn1\fP and \fIbbn\-unix\fP are more hypothetical very accurate
 timekeepers, at least one of which keeps time independently from
-\fIdcn\-gateway\fP, one hopes.
+\fIdcn\-gate\fP, one hopes.
 It is very likely that the time will be set to that one of those three
 very accurate hosts, as long as at least two of them agree, or at least
 one of them agrees with the neighbor or the local host's time.
 If all the foreign hosts disagree, the time will not be set,
 since \fBlocalhost\fP will be chosen as best.
-.SH "netdate\ \-l\ 3\ localhost\ localhost\ udp\ dcn\-gateway\ dcn1\ tcp\ bbn\-unix"
+.SH "netdate\ \-l\ 3\ localhost\ localhost\ udp\ dcn\-gate\ dcn1\ tcp\ bbn\-unix"
 This example gives \fBlocalhost\fP two votes and declares it to usually
 have the most accurate time.
 All three foreign hosts must agree within three seconds
