# A brief note about mpms:
#
# "prefork" is the legacy forked mpm, used with mod_php. Starting with httpd 
# 2.4.0, new threaded mpms are available, and previously experimental mpms are
# now stable
#
# Non-threaded mpms are no longer required, since php applications can now be
# deployed with the help of mod_fcgid, essentially a set of fixed dedicated cgi
# processes spawned for the whole purpose of executing dynamic applications
#
# Threaded mpms, by their very nature, are far more scalable than the
# traditional preforking solution. They consume less memory for the same
# workload, when serving the same amount of clients. httpd 2.4 ships with two
# options, "event" and "worker", where the former is the default mpm used if
# none is specified at the ./configure line
#
# Lastly, the "prefork" mpm can be used with mod_php as of version 5.4.0,
# which yields a much improved stability, even with most mod_php extensions
# loaded.
#
# The running mpm can be changed by simply loading the module. Here is a sample:
# LoadModule mpm_event_module lib(64)/httpd/modules/mod_mpm_event.so
#
# When upgrading from 2.2, please make sure to stop the deamon first, or your
# new instance may segfault.

# Fix config.layout to use lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}:
sed -i -e "s#lib/httpd#lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/httpd#" config.layout

# If /var/run becomes a tmpfs or a link to /run, subdirectories could be a problem.
# Just use /var/run rather than /var/run/httpd.
