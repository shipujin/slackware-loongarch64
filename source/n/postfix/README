Postfix is Wietse Venema's mailer that started life as an alternative to the
widely-used Sendmail program. It attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and
secure, while at the same time, being sendmail compatible enough to not upset
existing users. Thus, the outside has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is
completely different.

This script builds postfix with support for Dovecot SASL, Cyrus SASL, and
TLS (using OpenSSL.) Support for Berkeley DB hash and btree maps, being a
Postfix requirement, is also detected and built.

In addition database plugins are built for LDAP, MySQL, PCRE and sqlite3. To
add support for additional database plugins which are not provided in
Slackware, such as CDB or PostgreSQL, it is necessary to recompile this
package. See the comments in the SlackBuild script to get started.

Postfix manual sections follow the BSD standard, where section 8 is only for
daemons, and all user commands, even root-user-only administrative commands
such as postfix(1), are in section 1.

Postfix is exceptionally well documented. If you put a link to your
html_directory (/usr/doc/postfix/html) somewhere you can find it in your
favorite browser, all of this will be readily available to you. The place
to start is not with man pages, but with the various READMEs, all HTMLified
and with convenient hyperlinks to the relevant anchors in the HTML versions
of the manuals.
