# Start/stop/restart the BIND name server daemon (named).

# Start BIND. In the past it was more secure to run BIND as a non-root
# user (for example, with '-u daemon'), but the modern version of BIND
# knows how to use the kernel's capability mechanism to drop all root
# privileges except the ability to bind() to a privileged port and set
# process resource limits, so running as a non-root user is not needed.
# But if you want to run as a non-root user anyway, the command options
# can be set like this in /etc/default/named:
#       NAMED_OPTIONS="-u daemon"
# So you will not have to edit this script.
#
# Please note that if you run BIND as a non-root user, your files in
# /var/named may need to be chowned to this user or else named will
# refuse to start.

# You might also consider running BIND in a "chroot jail",
# a discussion of which may be found in
# /usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs/Chroot-BIND-HOWTO.
 
# One last note: rndc has a lot of other nice features that it is not
# within the scope of this start/stop/restart script to support.
# For more details, see "man rndc" or just type "rndc" to see the options.

# Load command defaults:
if [ -f /etc/default/named ] ; then . /etc/default/named ; fi
if [ -f /etc/default/rndc ] ; then . /etc/default/rndc ; fi

# Sanity check. If /usr/sbin/named is missing then it
# doesn't make much sense to try to run this script:
if [ ! -x /usr/sbin/named ]; then
  echo "/etc/rc.d/rc.bind:  no /usr/sbin/named found (or not executable); cannot start."
