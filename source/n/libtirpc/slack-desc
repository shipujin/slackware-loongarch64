# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libtirpc: libtirpc (Transport-Independent RPC library)
libtirpc:
libtirpc: Libtirpc is a port of Sun's Transport-Independent RPC library to
libtirpc: Linux. It is being developed by Bull GNU/Linux NFSv4 project.
libtirpc:
libtirpc: You will need this library if you plan to use RPC with a GLIBC
libtirpc: version newer than 2.13, because the RPC stack has been removed
libtirpc: from GLIBC versions newer than 2.13. The library is required
libtirpc: by the 'rpcbind' package.
