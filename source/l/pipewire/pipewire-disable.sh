# This script will attempt to disable pipewire as the default audio server,
# changing it back to pulseaudio.

for file in /etc/xdg/autostart/pipewire-media-session.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/pipewire-pulse.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/pipewire.desktop ; do
  if [ -r $file ]; then

if grep -q "^Hidden=true$" /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop ; then
  grep -v "^Hidden=true$" /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop > /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop.new
  mv /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop.new /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop
fi

# Edit /etc/pulse/client.conf to enable autospawn:
sed -i "s/autospawn = no/autospawn = yes/g" /etc/pulse/client.conf
sed -i "s/allow-autospawn-for-root = no/allow-autospawn-for-root = yes/g" /etc/pulse/client.conf
