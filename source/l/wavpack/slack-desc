# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

wavpack: wavpack (WAV audio file compressor)
wavpack:
wavpack: WavPack is a completely open audio compression format providing
wavpack: lossless, high-quality lossy, and a unique hybrid compression mode.
wavpack: The hybrid mode creates both a relatively small, high-quality lossy
wavpack: file that can be used all by itself, and a "correction" file that
wavpack: (when combined with the lossy file) provides full lossless
wavpack: restoration.
