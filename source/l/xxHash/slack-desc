# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xxHash:
xxHash: xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed
xxHash: limits. It successfully completes the [SMHasher]
xxHash: (https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/SMHasher) test suite which
xxHash: evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash
xxHash: functions. Code is highly portable, and hashes are identical on all
