# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libdeflate: libdeflate (fast compression/decompression library)
libdeflate:
libdeflate: libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based
libdeflate: compression and decompression supporting DEFLATE (raw), zlib (aka
libdeflate: DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper), and gzip (aka DEFLATE with a gzip
libdeflate: wrapper). libdeflate is heavily optimized. It is significantly faster
libdeflate: than the zlib library, especially on x86 processors. In addition,
libdeflate: libdeflate provides optional high compression modes that provide a
libdeflate: better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".
