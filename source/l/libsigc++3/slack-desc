# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libsigc++3: libsigc++3 (callback system for standard C++ v3)
libsigc++3:
libsigc++3: libsigc++3 implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++.
libsigc++3: It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
libsigc++3: callback function, either global or a member function, regardless
libsigc++3: of whether it is static or virtual. It also contains adaptor classes
libsigc++3: for connection of dissimilar callbacks.
