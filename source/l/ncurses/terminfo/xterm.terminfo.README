This is based on the xterm terminfo definition file from xterm-331, but the
xterm definition has been changed to remove use=ansi+rep which was causing
problems with terminals that set themselves to xterm but aren't compatible
with use=ansi+rep (including Konsole and the console app in OSX).

The definition that includes the rep= feature remains available as xterm-new.
