# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

Mako: Mako (template library written in Python)
Mako:
Mako: Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar,
Mako: non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum
Mako: performance. Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many
Mako: others, including Django and Jinja2 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and
Mako: Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded Python language.
