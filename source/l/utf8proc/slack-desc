# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

utf8proc: utf8proc (Unicode processing library)
utf8proc:
utf8proc: utf8proc is a small, clean C library that provides Unicode
utf8proc: normalization, case-folding, and other operations for data in the
utf8proc: UTF-8 encoding. It was initially developed by Jan Behrens and the
utf8proc: rest of the Public Software Group, who deserve nearly all of the
utf8proc: credit for this package. With the blessing of the Public Software
utf8proc: Group, the Julia developers have taken over development of utf8proc.
