# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-setuptools_scm: python-setuptools_scm (manages versions in SCM metadata)
python-setuptools_scm:
python-setuptools_scm: setuptools_scm handles managing your Python package versions in SCM
python-setuptools_scm: metadata instead of declaring them as the version argument or in a SCM
python-setuptools_scm: managed file. It also provides setuptools with a list of files that
python-setuptools_scm: are managed by the SCM. Git and mercurial are supported out of the
python-setuptools_scm: box.
