# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-MarkupSafe:
python-MarkupSafe: MarkupSafe implements a text object that escapes characters so it is
python-MarkupSafe: safe to use in HTML and XML. Characters that have special meanings are
python-MarkupSafe: replaced so that they display as the actual characters. This mitigates
python-MarkupSafe: injection attacks, meaning untrusted user input can safely be
python-MarkupSafe: displayed on a page.
