# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libdmtx: libdmtx (Data Matrix barcode library)
libdmtx:
libdmtx: libdmtx is a library that enables programs to read and write Data
libdmtx: Matrix barcodes of the modern ECC200 variety. The utility programs
libdmtx: dmtxread and dmtxwrite also provide a command line interface for
libdmtx: libdmtx, and serve as a good reference for developers writing their
libdmtx: own libdmtx-enabled programs.
