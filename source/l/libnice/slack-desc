# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libnice: libnice (Interactive Connectivity Establishment library)
libnice:
libnice: libnice is an implementation of the IETF draft Interactive
libnice: Connectivity Establishment standard (ICE). ICE is useful for
libnice: applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams.
libnice: It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security
libnice: against some attacks. Existing standards that use ICE include the
libnice: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Jingle, XMPP extension for
libnice: audio/video calls.
