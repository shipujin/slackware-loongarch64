# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zug: zug (Transducers for C++)
zug:
zug: zug is a C++ library providing 'transducers.' Transducers are
zug: composable sequential transformations independent of the source. They
zug: are extremely lightweight, and can be used to express algorithms over
zug: pull-based sequences (iterators, files) but also push based sequences
zug: (signals, events, asynchronous streams) in a generic way.
