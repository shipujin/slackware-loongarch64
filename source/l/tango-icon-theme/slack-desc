# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tango-icon-theme: The Tango Desktop Project has designed a basic set of desktop icons
tango-icon-theme: that follow the style guidelines. The set has been created as a proof
tango-icon-theme: of concept for the style, but works rather well as a replacement for
tango-icon-theme: the base theme under GNOME and KDE.
