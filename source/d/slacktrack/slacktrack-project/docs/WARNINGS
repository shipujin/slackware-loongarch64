1.  Do not Use on production servers
    ---------------------------------

    Do NOT run slacktrack on production servers.  

    It should only be run on a development box.
   
    This is because slacktrack version 2.0 and upwards install onto
    the filesystem of the server, rather than into a pseudo root.

2.  Slackware versions
    ------------------

    slacktrack has been tested on:
    - Slackware 12.0, 12.1, 12.2, 13.0
    - ARMedslack, all versions.

    It may works on previous releases of Slackware, it may not.

3.  slacktrack default working space
    --------------------------------

    By default, slacktrack puts its work space in 
    /var/tmp/<randomnumber>slacktrack

    It is essential that you have enough disk space on the
    partition on which /var/tmp resides - particularly if you use
    ${SLACKTRACKSCRATCHDIR}

    If you do not have enough space in /var/tmp then you can
    pass --tempdir to slacktrack to change the base temporary directory.

    eg you may do
    # slacktrack --tempdir /tmp/slacktrack -Qp "foobar-4.1-sparc-2.tgz" "/bin/sh foobar.build"
