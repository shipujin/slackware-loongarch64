This directory contains example scripts on which you may
base your own build scripts.

Note that the packages and versions are not current, but their
purpose is to serve as examples.

Slackware's packaging standard is that documents in /usr/doc are
chmod 644, so these examples are archived to retain the execute 
permissions on the build scripts.

Please extract the archive to /tmp to begin:
Example:

mkdir -pm /tmp/slacktrack
tar xf examples.tar.bz2 -C /tmp/slacktrack
