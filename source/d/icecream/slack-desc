# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

icecream: icecream (distributed C/C++ compiler daemon/scheduler)
icecream:
icecream: Icecream is a distributed compile system. Icecream was created by SUSE
icecream: based on distcc. Like distcc, Icecream takes compile jobs from a build
icecream: and distributes it among remote machines allowing a parallel build.
icecream: But unlike distcc, Icecream uses a central server that dynamically
icecream: schedules the compile jobs to the fastest free server.
