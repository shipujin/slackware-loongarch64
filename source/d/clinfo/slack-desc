# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

clinfo:
clinfo: A simple OpenCL application that enumerates all possible platform and
clinfo: device properties. Inspired by AMD's program of the same name, it is
clinfo: coded in pure C99 and it tries to output all possible information,
clinfo: including that provided by platform-specific extensions, and not to
clinfo: crash on platform-unsupported properties (e.g. 1.2 properties on 1.1
clinfo: platforms).
