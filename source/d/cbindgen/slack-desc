# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cbindgen: cbindgen (Generate C/C++ headers for Rust libraries)
cbindgen:
cbindgen: cbindgen creates C/C++11 headers for Rust libraries which expose a
cbindgen: public C API. While you could do this by hand, it's not a particularly
cbindgen: good use of your time. It's also much more likely to be error-prone
cbindgen: than machine-generated headers that are based on your actual Rust
cbindgen: code. The cbindgen developers have also worked closely with the
cbindgen: developers of Rust to ensure that the headers we generate reflect
cbindgen: actual guarantees about Rust's type layout and ABI.
