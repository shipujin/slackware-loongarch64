# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nvi: nvi (ex/vi text editor)
nvi:
nvi: Nvi is an implementation of the ex/vi text editor. Nvi supports all
nvi: the historic ex/vi features except for open mode and the lisp edit
nvi: option (it has a fully implemented underlying ex mode). Some
nvi: additional features are: extended regular expressions, infinite undo,
nvi: UTF8 support, and multiple edit buffers. Nvi has a very small memory
nvi: footprint.
