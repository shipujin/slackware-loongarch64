The purpose of the /mnt directory is to provide a place for the admin to
mount block device temporarily.  Any of the subdirectories of /mnt may be
used, or volumes may even be mounted directly on /mnt (which is the
traditional way of doing things, though /mnt/tmp is also provided for
the purpose of mounting any kind of volume temporarily).

See the /media directory also.
