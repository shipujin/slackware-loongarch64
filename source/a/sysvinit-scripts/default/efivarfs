# By default, we will mount efivarfs read-write on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars.
# This is needed in order to create or modify EFI boot menu entries.
# If you do not want this, you may set the variable below to 'ro' for
# read-only, or 'nomount' (or anything else) if you do not want rc.S to mount
# efivarfs. However, if might still be mounted by /etc/fstab or elsewhere.
