# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

inih: inih (INI Not Invented Here)
inih:
inih: inih (INI Not Invented Here)** is a simple .INI file parser written in
inih: C. It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was designed to be
inih: small and simple, so it's good for embedded systems. It's also more or
inih: less compatible with Python's ConfigParser style of .INI files,
inih: including RFC 822-style multi-line syntax and `name: value` entries.
