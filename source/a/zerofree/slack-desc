# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zerofree: zerofree (zero free blocks from ext* filesystems)
zerofree:
zerofree: Zerofree finds the unallocated, non-zeroed blocks in an ext2, ext3,
zerofree: or ext4 filesystem and fills them with zeroes. This is useful if the
zerofree: device on which this file-system resides is a disk image. In this
zerofree: case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary utility may be
zerofree: able to reduce the size of the disk image after zerofree has been run.
