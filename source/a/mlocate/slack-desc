# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

mlocate: mlocate (locate/updatedb implementation)
mlocate:
mlocate: mlocate is a locate/updatedb implementation. It keeps a database of
mlocate: all existing files and allows you to lookup files by name. The 'm'
mlocate: stands for "merging": updatedb reuses the existing database to avoid
mlocate: rereading most of the file system, which makes updatedb faster and
mlocate: does not trash the system caches as much as traditional locate
mlocate: implementations. The locate(1) utility is intended to be completely
mlocate: compatible to slocate. It also attempts to be compatible to GNU
mlocate: locate, when it does not conflict with slocate compatibility.
