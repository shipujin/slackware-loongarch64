# Default options for /usr/sbin/geninitrd:

# Would you rather run a custom script instead of /usr/sbin/geninitrd?
# If so, set it below and it will be used instead:
#GENINITRD_OVERRIDE_SCRIPT=/usr/local/sbin/geninitrd-custom

# This variable defines the kernel that the initrd should be made for.
# However, if a kernel is provided on the command line:
# geninitrd /boot/vmlinuz-6.12.1
# Then this will be used instead.
# The value of KERNEL is also not replaced if it was already defined:
# KERNEL=/boot/vmlinuz-6.12.1 geninitrd
# If there's no kernel defined by the command line or by the KERNEL
# variable, then as a last resort we'll use the newest kernel we find
# in /boot.
KERNEL=/boot/vmlinuz-generic

# In addition to the initrd with a name like initrd-6.11.6.img,
# should we make a compatibility symlink such as initrd-generic.img?
# GRUB doesn't require this, but lilo and elilo might.
GENINITRD_NAMED_SYMLINK=true

# In addition to the initrd with a name like initrd-6.11.6.img,
# should we make a compatibility symlink named initrd.gz?
# GRUB doesn't require this, but lilo and elilo might.
GENINITRD_INITRD_GZ_SYMLINK=true

# Which initrd generating tool should we use?
# The supported options are mkinitrd_command_generator.sh,
# mkinitrd (falls back to mkinitrd_command_generator.sh if
# there is no /etc/mkinitrd.conf), or dracut.
GENERATOR=mkinitrd

# If we are using dracut, we'll use these options:
DRACUT_OPTS="--force --hostonly"

# Should we allow the kernel install script to automatically
# generate an initrd?
AUTOGENERATE_INITRD=true

# Should we automatically remove "orphaned" initrds, i.e. any initrd that
# does not have a matching kernel version in /boot?
AUTO_REMOVE_ORPHANED_INITRDS=true

# Should we display the dialog splash screen?
GENINITRD_DIALOG=false

# Should we display the output from the generator and remove-orphaned-initrds?
GENINITRD_COMMAND_OUTPUT=true
