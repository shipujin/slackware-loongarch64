# This file lists shared library symlinks for libraries we would
# like to keep copies of temporarily until we can recompile
# everything that's still using them.  Once that happens, they'll
# be dropped from this package.
#
# We need these libraries here or we won't be able to recompile gcc
# after any of them get a shared library .so-version bump:
/usr/lib/libisl.so.22
/usr/lib/libmpc.so.3
/usr/lib/libmpfr.so.6
/usr/lib/libgmp.so.10
/usr/lib/libgmpxx.so.4
# Need these saved here during the KDE4 -> Plasma 5 transition:
# exiv2:
/usr/lib/libexiv2.so.26
# LibRaw:
/usr/lib/libraw.so.16
/usr/lib/libraw_r.so.16
# poppler:
/usr/lib/libpoppler-qt4.so.4

/usr/lib/libIex-2_2.so.12
/usr/lib/libIexMath-2_2.so.12
/usr/lib/libIlmThread-2_2.so.12
