# This file lists shared library symlinks for libraries we would
# like to keep copies of temporarily until we can recompile
# everything that's still using them.  Once that happens, they'll
# be dropped from this package.
#
# We need these libraries here or we won't be able to recompile gcc
# after any of them get a shared library .so-version bump:
/usr/lib/libisl.so.22
/usr/lib/libmpc.so.3
/usr/lib/libmpfr.so.6
/usr/lib/libgmp.so.10
/usr/lib/libgmpxx.so.4
#
# Add the shared library from libdvdread-6.0.1 until third party packages catch up:
#
/usr/lib/libdvdread.so.4
# Need these saved here during the KDE4 -> Plasma 5 transition:
/usr/lib/libexiv2.so.26
/usr/lib/libraw.so.16
/usr/lib/libraw_r.so.16
# We'll keep this one around for just a little bit:
/usr/lib/libffi.so.6
# Upgrading icu4c is always painful. We'll hang onto these until nothing in the
# main tree or common third-party additions require them.
/usr/lib/libicudata.so.65
/usr/lib/libicui18n.so.65
/usr/lib/libicuio.so.65
/usr/lib/libicutest.so.65
/usr/lib/libicutu.so.65
