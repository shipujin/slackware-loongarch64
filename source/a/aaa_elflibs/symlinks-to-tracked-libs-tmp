# This file lists shared library symlinks for libraries we would
# like to keep copies of temporarily until we can recompile
# everything that's still using them.  Once that happens, they'll
# be dropped from this package.
#
# We need these libraries here or we won't be able to recompile gcc
# after any of them get a shared library .so-version bump:
/usr/lib/libisl.so.21
/usr/lib/libmpc.so.3
/usr/lib/libmpfr.so.6
/usr/lib/libgmp.so.10
/usr/lib/libgmpxx.so.4
#
# Add the shared libraries from icu4c-64.2 until third party packages catch up:
#
/usr/lib/libicudata.so.64
/usr/lib/libicui18n.so.64
/usr/lib/libicuio.so.64
/usr/lib/libicutest.so.64
/usr/lib/libicutu.so.64
/usr/lib/libicuuc.so.64
