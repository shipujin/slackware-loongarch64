# Compilation with glibc version later than 2.3.2 needs the environment
# variable DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION set to 199209.
# Without that line, the coreutils will start complaining about 'obsolete'
# command switches, like "tail -20" will be considered obsolete.
# This behaviour breaks many other packages... the 'obsolete' parameters are
# too commonly used to disregard them.  Better to stick with the older more
# widely accepted standards until things begin to demand the new way.

# Don't use the openssl crypto library, otherwise /bin/sort ends up linked
