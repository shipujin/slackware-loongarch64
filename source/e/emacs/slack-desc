# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

emacs: Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
emacs: display editor. If this seems to be a bit of a mouthful, an easier
emacs: explanation is that Emacs is a text editor and more. At its core is an
emacs: interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language
emacs: with extensions to support text editing.
