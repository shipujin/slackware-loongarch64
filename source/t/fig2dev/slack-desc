# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

fig2dev: fig2dev (transform .fig files)
fig2dev:
fig2dev: This package contains the binaries to transform .fig files (created by
fig2dev: xfig) to some other formats like epsf and LaTeX. If you have installed
fig2dev: xfig, you should also install this package if you want to use xfig to
fig2dev: create other files than .fig files, which can then be included in your
fig2dev: LaTeX documents.
