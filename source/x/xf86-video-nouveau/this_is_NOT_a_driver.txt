This is not the experimental nouveau driver for nVidia cards.

It is a stub package that installs /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-blacklist.conf,
to prevent the nouveau dri module shipped with our kernel from preventing
the nv driver and/or the binary nVidia driver from working.

If you want to use nouveau, remove this package.

Sorry if it interferes with anyone's xf86-video-nouveau package that they
didn't get from us, but this seems like the best default.  When a real
xf86-video-nouveau package appears someday, installing it will remove
the module blacklist file.
