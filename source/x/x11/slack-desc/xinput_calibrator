# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

xinput_calibrator: xinput_calibrator (touchscreen calibration program)
xinput_calibrator:
xinput_calibrator: Xinput_calibrator is based on a simple calibrator that was proposed on
xinput_calibrator: the Xorg mailing list. The first release improved upon it by reading
xinput_calibrator: axis valuators from Xinput, hence making it generic for all
xinput_calibrator: touchscreen drivers.
