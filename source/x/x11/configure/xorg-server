# Build rootless X packages. This is not the default in Slackware and is
# unlikely to be any time soon, as --enable-systemd-logind seems to really
# require systemd and does not function 100% with all graphics chipsets.
# In particular, resuming from suspend may not work with (at least) Radeon
# chipsets, and NVIDIA chipsets using proprietary drivers. Also, while
# rootless X works from "startx", it is unsupported by most login managers
# which will continue to start X as root.
#
# Feel free to try it out, though. To build rootless X packages, start the
# build like this:
#
# ROOTLESSX=YES ./x11.SlackBuild xserver xorg-server
#

  # Here we are building the traditional setuid root X. Technically we could
  # dispense with the Xorg.wrap wrapper and just have the actual Xorg binary
  # in /usr/bin, but we've always had the wrapper anyway and it should not
  # cause any problems. Besides, it might be possible with this configuration
  # to remove the setuid permissions from /usr/libexec/Xorg and then add the
  # user to required groups such as input to run rootless as well, though it
  # may bring its own security issues since other users who are members of
  # these groups could monitor the devices. It's not recommended to try to
  # run X rootless in this way, but we're going to keep the option open for now.
