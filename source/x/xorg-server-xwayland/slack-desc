# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xorg-server-xwayland: xorg-server-xwayland (X Clients under Wayland)
xorg-server-xwayland:
xorg-server-xwayland: Wayland is a complete window system in itself, but even so, if we're
xorg-server-xwayland: migrating away from X, it makes sense to have a good backwards
xorg-server-xwayland: compatibility story. With a few changes, the Xorg server can be
xorg-server-xwayland: modified to use Wayland input devices for input and forward either the
xorg-server-xwayland: root window or individual top-level windows as wayland surfaces. The
xorg-server-xwayland: server still runs the same 2D driver with the same acceleration code
xorg-server-xwayland: as it does when it runs natively. The main difference is that Wayland
xorg-server-xwayland: handles presentation of the windows instead of KMS.
