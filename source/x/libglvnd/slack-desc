# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libglvnd: libglvnd (The GL Vendor-Neutral Dispatch library)
libglvnd:
libglvnd: libglvnd is a vendor-neutral dispatch layer for arbitrating OpenGL
libglvnd: API calls between multiple vendors. It allows multiple drivers from
libglvnd: different vendors to coexist on the same filesystem, and determines
libglvnd: which vendor to dispatch each API call to at runtime.
