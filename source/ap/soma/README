Soma - a dialog internet radio player

For help/usage see soma -h

Soma started off as a way to play .pls playlists from SomaFM but can
also play .ram playlists too. In fact any url playable by mplayer
using the -playlist option should work. Extra stations can be added
in ~/.soma/stations.conf (up to 200).

Soma uses mplayer to play the streams and aplay to detect cards for
mixer so mplayer and alsa-utils need to be installed.

Key commands supported in status window:

(       Volume -5
)       Volume +5
1 - 0   Volume 10%, 20%, ... 100% (saved)
Space   Pause/Play
d       Disconnect/Reconnect
a       Add schedule
b       Station browser
m       Mute toggle
s       Scheduler
q       Quit

There are 3 config files:

~/.soma/themes/*rcrc		Specify the dialog colours.
~/.soma/options.conf		A few extra options.
~/.soma/stations.conf		User station list.

There are also:

/etc/soma/options.conf          Default options.
/etc/soma/themes/*rc            Dialog configs.
/etc/soma/stations.conf         Default station list.

Stations should be added to the user list like this:

Name,URL

You cannot use a comma , in the name or URL

I would be glad of any exra radio urls emailed to me so I can add to
the default list.

NOTES:

The Jack and NAS options for output device will only work if MPlayer is
built against them.

When changing/selecting soundcard output device you must press space on
the option. Just scrolling down and hitting Enter does nothing.

BUGS:

Soma may induce the side effects of general well-being and profound 
spiritual satisfaction.

REAL BUGS:

Some people might find screen messes up the dialog colours. If you
have this line in ~/.screenrc:

attrcolor b ".I"

You might want to comment it out and try again as it seems to turn off
the bold attribute.

Please mail me at dave@dawoodfall.net for new radio urls or bug
reports etc.
