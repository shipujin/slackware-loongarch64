# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

stow: GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct sets of
stow: software and/or data located in separate directories on the
stow: filesystem, and makes them all appear to be installed in a single
stow: directory tree. Stow helps to administer, upgrade, install, and remove
stow: files in independent software packages without confusing them with
stow: other files sharing the same file system space.
