# Upstream source references.
# Stuart Winter <mozes@slackware.com>
#
# Incase you're wondering why we're using source RPMs, this is because they contain
# patches required to either fix build or runtime problems, and it's easier to
# maintain this hunk of a package when the patches & sources are self contained.
#
# Some sources have been recompressed with LZMA for better compression results.
#
# Note: Due to the passage of time, certain SRPM URLs may no longer be accessible,
# having been stored in the Slackware repository for several years. To minimise
# unnecessary churn within in the Slackware source tree, we update the SRPMs only
# when their content has been modified.
