These are modified versions of some sysvinit-scripts and network-scripts for
Slackware for use in a container (although they should also work for a regular
non-container system as well).

Versions ending in .lxc are the scripts to be used in a container.
Versions ending in .orig are the scripts from the sysvinit-scripts and
network-scripts packages that the .lxc scripts are based on.

Any changes made to the original scripts in sysvinit-scripts or network-scripts
*may* need to be ported to these versions.
