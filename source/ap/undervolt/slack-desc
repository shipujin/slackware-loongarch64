# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

undervolt: undervolt (undervolt Intel CPUs)
undervolt:
undervolt: undervolt is a program for undervolting Intel CPUs under Linux. It
undervolt: works in a similar manner to the Windows program *ThrottleStop* (i.e.:
undervolt: MSR 0x150). You can apply a fixed voltage offset to one of 5 voltage
undervolt: planes, and override your systems temperature target (CPU will
undervolt: throttle when this temperature is reached). Use at your own risk.
