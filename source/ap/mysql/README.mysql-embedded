The mysql-embedded.SlackBuild produces a package containing
a static libmysqld.a library (and some support files) that
is required in order to build applications that embed a
mysql server (such as amarok).  If you need to build such
applications, first you'll need to use this SlackBuild to
prepare a mysql package that contains embedded support and
install it on your system.
