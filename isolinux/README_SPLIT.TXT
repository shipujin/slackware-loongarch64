
Hello,

Thanks for noticing this README-encrypted file.  :-)

When found on a disc-media based Slackware distribution, this file indicates
an incomplete software series that continues on the next disc.  

The installer will ask for the next disc and look for the rest of the
packages there.  If you are installing packages from the command line, look
at the next disc to make certain that you install all the packages you need.

For example, to split /slackware/kde across two discs, both discs will need
to have /slackware/kde directories.  The first one should contain a copy of
this file.  The second one should have the install.end file, the additional
packages not in the first directory, and an extra copy of the tagfile file.

Have fun!
