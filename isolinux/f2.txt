You'll need one kernel to get Linux started on your system so that you can
install it.  The default kernel is huge.s, which requires at least a
Athlon64 processor.  This kernel now includes Speakup support as well.

To boot the chosen kernel put the name of the kernel and press enter.

boot: huge.s  "For example, boot the 'huge.s' kernel!"

To check your system memory with memtest86+, use 'memtest':

boot: memtest
