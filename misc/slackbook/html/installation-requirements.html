<p>An easy Slackware installation requires, at minimum, the following:</p>

<p>If you have the bootable CD, you will probably not need a floppy drive. Of course, it
stands to reason that if you don't possess a CD-ROM drive, you will need a floppy drive
to do a network install. A network card is required for an NFS install. See the section
called NFS for more information.</p>

<p>The disk space requirement is somewhat tricky. The 1GB recommendation is usually safe
for a minimal install, but if you do a full install, you will need around two gigabytes
of available hard disk space plus additional space for personal files.. Most users don't
do a full install. In fact, many run Slackware on as little as 100MB of hard disk
space.</p>

<p>Slackware can be installed to systems with less RAM, smaller hard drives, and weaker
CPUs, but doing so will require a little elbow grease. If you're up for a little work,
take a look at the <tt class="FILENAME">LOWMEM.TXT</tt> file in the distribution tree for
a few helpful hints.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="INSTALLATION-SOFTWARE-SERIES"

<p>For reasons of simplicity, Slackware has historically been divided into software
series. Once called &#8220;disk sets&#8221; because they were designed for floppy-based
installation, the software series are now used primarily to categorize the packages
included in Slackware. Today, floppy installation is no longer possible.</p>

<p>The following is a brief description of each software series.</p>

<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="INSTALLATION-INSTALLATION-METHODS-FLOPPY"
name="INSTALLATION-INSTALLATION-METHODS-FLOPPY">3.2.2.1 Floppy</a></h3>

<p>While it was once possible to install all of Slackware Linux from floppy disks, the
increasing size of software packages (indeed, of some individual programs) has forced the
abandonment of the floppy install. As late as Slackware version 7.1 a partial install was
possible using floppy disks. The A and N series could be nearly entirely installed,
providing a base system from which to install the rest of the distribution. If you are
considering a floppy install (typically on older hardware), it is typically recommended
to find another way, or use an older release. Slackware 4.0 is still very popular for
this reason, as is 7.0.</p>

<p>Please note that floppy disks are still required for a CD-ROM install if you do not
have a bootable CD, as well as for an NFS install.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="INSTALLATION-INSTALLLATION-METHODS-CDROM"
name="INSTALLATION-INSTALLLATION-METHODS-CDROM">3.2.2.2 CD-ROM</a></h3>

<p>If you have the bootable CD, available in the official disc set published by Slackware
Linux, Inc. (see the section called Getting Slackware), a CD-based installation will be a
bit simpler for you. If not, you will need to boot from floppies. Also, if you have
special hardware that makes usage of the kernel on the bootable CD problematic, you may
need to use specialized floppies.</p>

<p>As of Slackware version 8.1, a new method is used for creating the bootable CDs, which
does not work as well with certain flaky BIOS chips (it is worth noting that most all
Linux CDs suffer from this these days). If that is the case, we recommend booting from a
floppy disk.</p>

<p><a
href="installation-requirements.html#INSTALLATION-INSTALLATION-METHODS-BOOTDISK">Section
3.2.3</a> and <a
href="installation-requirements.html#INSTALLATION-SUPPLEMENTAL-DISK">Section 3.2.5</a>
provide information on choosing and creating floppies from which to boot, should this be
necessary.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN823" name="AEN823">3.2.2.3 NFS</a></h3>

<p>NFS (the Network File System) is a way of making filesystems available to remote
machines. An NFS install allows you to install Slackware from another computer on your
network. The machine from which you are installing needs to be configured to export the
Slackware distribution tree to the machine to which you're installing. This, of course,
involves some knowledge of NFS, which is covered in <a
href="network-configuration-nfs.html">Section 5.6</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible to perform an NFS install via such methods as PLIP (over a parallel
port), SLIP, and PPP (though not over a modem connection). However, we recommend the use
of a network card if available. After all, installing an operating system through your
printer port is going to be a very, very slow process.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="INSTALLATION-INSTALLATION-METHODS-BOOTDISK"
name="INSTALLATION-INSTALLATION-METHODS-BOOTDISK">3.2.3 Boot Disk</a></h2>

<p>The boot disk is the floppy you actually boot from to begin the installation. It
contains a compressed kernel image which is used to control the hardware during
installation. Therefore, it is very much required (unless you're booting from CD, as is
discussed in the section called CD-ROM). The boot disks are located in the <tt
class="FILENAME">bootdisks/</tt> directory in the distribution tree.</p>

<p>There are more Slackware boot disks than you can shake a stick at (which is to say
about 16). A complete list of boot disks, with a description of each, is available in the
Slackware distribution tree in the file <tt class="FILENAME">bootdisks/README.TXT</tt>.
However, most people are able to use the <tt class="FILENAME">bare.i</tt> (for IDE
devices) or <tt class="FILENAME">scsi.s</tt> (for SCSI devices) boot disk image.</p>

<p>See <a href="installation-requirements.html#INSTALLATION-MAKING-THE-DISKS">Section
3.2.6</a> for instructions on making a disk from an image.</p>

<p>After booting, you will be prompted to insert the root disk. We recommend that you
just humor the boot disk and play along.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="INSTALLATION-INSTALLATION-METHODS-ROOTDISK"
name="INSTALLATION-INSTALLATION-METHODS-ROOTDISK">3.2.4 Root Disk</a></h2>

<p>The root disks contain the setup program and a filesystem which is used during
installation. They are also required. The root disk images are located in the directory
rootdisks in the distribution tree. You'll have to make two root disks from the <tt
class="FILENAME">install.1</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">install.2</tt> images. Here you
can also find the <tt class="FILENAME">network.dsk</tt>, <tt
class="FILENAME">pcmcia.dsk</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">rescue.dsk</tt>, and <tt
class="FILENAME">sbootmgr.dsk</tt> disks.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="INSTALLATION-SUPPLEMENTAL-DISK"
name="INSTALLATION-SUPPLEMENTAL-DISK">3.2.5 Supplemental Disk</a></h2>

<p>A supplemental disk is needed if you are performing an NFS install or installing to a
system with PCMCIA devices. Supplemental disks are in the rootdsks directory in the
distribution tree, with the filenames <tt class="FILENAME">network.dsk</tt> and <tt
class="FILENAME">pcmcia.dsk</tt>. Recently other supplemental disks such as <tt
class="FILENAME">rescue.dsk</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">sbootmgr.dsk</tt> have been
added. The rescue disk is a small floppy root image that runs in a 4MB RAM drive. It
includes some basic networking utilities and the vi editor for quick fixes on busted
machines. The <tt class="FILENAME">sbootmgr.dsk</tt> disk is used to boot other devices.
Boot off this disk if your bootable CD-ROM drive doesn't want to boot the Slackware CDs.
It will prompt you for different things to boot and may offer a convenient way to work
around a buggy BIOS.</p>

<p>The root disk will instruct you on the use of supplemental disks when it is
loaded.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="INSTALLATION-MAKING-THE-DISKS"
name="INSTALLATION-MAKING-THE-DISKS">3.2.6 Making the Disks</a></h2>

<p>Once you've selected a boot disk image, you need to put it on a floppy. The process is
slightly different depending on which operating system you're using to make the disks. If
you're running Linux (or pretty much any Unix-like OS) you'll need to use the <tt
class="COMMAND">dd</tt>(1) command. Assuming <tt class="FILENAME">bare.i</tt> is your
disk image file and your floppy drive is <tt class="FILENAME">/dev/fd0</tt>, the command
to make a <tt class="FILENAME">bare.i</tt> floppy is:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN">
<samp class="PROMPT">%</samp> <kbd class="USERINPUT">dd if=bare.i of=/dev/fd0</kbd>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you're running a Microsoft OS, you'll need to use the <tt
class="FILENAME">RAWRITE.EXE</tt> program, which is included in the distribution tree in
the same directories as the floppy images. Again assuming that <tt
class="FILENAME">bare.i</tt> is your disk image file and your floppy drive is <tt
class="FILENAME">A:</tt>, open a DOS prompt and type the following:</p>

<table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN">
C:\ <kbd class="USERINPUT">rawrite a: bare.i</kbd>
