# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

frei0r-plugins: be controlled by parameters. Its goal is that these simple effects can
frei0r-plugins: be shared between many applications, avoiding their reimplementation
frei0r-plugins: by different projects.
