Here are some kernel configs that may be helpful for compiling a 3.4.x
Linux kernel.  The 3.4.x series was tested here, but there's a problem
where on about 10% of the boots on my machine, clocksource hpet will be
selected instead of clocksource tsc, and the kernel will oops.  However,
passing clocksource=hpet at boot works fine.

It seems safer to stick to the 3.2.x series for release...
