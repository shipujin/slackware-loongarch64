libdmtx: libdmtx (Data Matrix barcode library)
libdmtx:
libdmtx: libdmtx is a library that enables programs to read and write Data
libdmtx: Matrix barcodes of the modern ECC200 variety. The utility programs
libdmtx: dmtxread and dmtxwrite also provide a command line interface for
libdmtx: libdmtx, and serve as a good reference for developers writing their
libdmtx: own libdmtx-enabled programs.
