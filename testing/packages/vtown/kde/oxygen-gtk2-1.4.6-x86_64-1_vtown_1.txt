oxygen-gtk2: oxygen-gtk2 (Oxygen GTK+ engine)
oxygen-gtk2:
oxygen-gtk2: Oxygen-Gtk2 is a port of the KDE widget theme Oxygen, to GTK+. Its
oxygen-gtk2: primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between GTK+ and qt-based
oxygen-gtk2: applications running under KDE. A secondary objective is to also have
oxygen-gtk2: a stand-alone nice looking GTK+ theme that would behave well on other
oxygen-gtk2: desktop environments. Unlike other attempts made to port the KDE
oxygen-gtk2: oxygen theme to GTK+, this attempt does not depend on Qt.
