kinit: kinit (startup helper library)
kinit:
kinit: kdeinit is a process launcher somewhat similar to the famous init used
kinit: for booting. It launches processes by forking and then loading a
kinit: dynamic library which should contain a 'kdemain(...)' function. Using
kinit: kdeinit to launch KDE applications makes starting a typical KDE
kinit: application 2.5 times faster and reduces memory consumption.
