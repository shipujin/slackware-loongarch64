<p>A graphical user interface (GUI) that runs atop the X Window System and provides such
features as integrated applications, cohesive look-and-feel between programs and
components, file and window management capabilities, etc. A step beyond the simple window
manager.</p>
</dd>

decimal) separated by periods.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Dynamic loader</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>When programs are compiled under Linux, they usually use pieces of code (functions)

the required functions loaded into memory. This is the job of the dynamic loader.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Environment variable</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A variable set in the user's shell which can be referenced by that user or programs
run by that user within that shell. Environment variables are generally used to store

1, 1970. This is considered the &#8220;dawn of time&#8221; by Unix and Unix-like
operating systems, and all other time is calculated relative to this date.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Filesystem</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A representation of stored data in which &#8220;files&#8221; of data are kept

the foreground.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Framebuffer</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A type of graphics device; in Linux, this most often refers to the software
framebuffer, which provides a standard framebuffer interface to programs while keeping
specific hardware drivers hidden from them. This layer of abstraction frees programs of
the need to speak to various hardware drivers.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>The File Transfer Protocol. FTP is a very popular method of transferring data between
computers.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Gateway</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A computer through which data on a network is transferred to another network.</p>
</dd>

control and interfaces with the computer's hardware.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Kernel module</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A piece of kernel code, usually a driver of some sort, that can be loaded and unloaded
from memory separately from the main body of the kernel. Modules are handy when upgrading
drivers or testing kernel settings, because they can be loaded and unloaded without
rebooting.</p>

<dd>
<p>A running program.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Root directory</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Represented as &#8220;/&#8221;, the root directory exists at the top of the

connected to which network, etc.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Runlevel</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The overall system state as defined by init. Runlevel 6 is rebooting, runlevel 1 is

<dt><b>Service</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The sharing of information and/or data between programs and computers from a single
&#8220;server&#8221; to multiple &#8220;clients&#8221;. HTTP, FTP, NFS, etc. are
services.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Shadow password suite</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The shadow password suite allows encrypted passwords to be hidden from users, while
the rest of the information in the <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/passwd</tt> file remains
visible to all. This helps prevent brute-force attempts at cracking passwords.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Shell</b></dt>

<p>Shells provide a commandline interface to the user. When you're looking at a text
prompt, you're in a shell.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Shell builtin</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A command built into the shell, as opposed to being provided by an external program.
For instance, <tt class="COMMAND">bash</tt> has a <tt class="COMMAND">cd</tt>
builtin.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Signal</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Unix programs can communicate between each other using simple &#8220;signals&#8221;,

</dd>

<dt><b>Source code</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The (more or less) human-readable code in which most programs are written. Source code
is compiled into &#8220;binary&#8221; code.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Standard Error (stderr)</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The Unix-standard output stream for errors. Programs write any error messages on
stderr, so that they can be separated from normal output.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Standard Input (stdin)</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The Unix-standard input stream. Data can be redirected or piped into a program's stdin
from any source.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Standard Output (stdout)</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The Unix-standard output stream. Normal text output from a program is written to
stdout, which is separate from the error messages reported on stderr and can be piped or
redirected into other programs' stdin or to a file.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Subnet</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>An IP address range that is part of a larger range. For instance, 192.168.1.0 is a
subnet of 192.168.0.0 (where 0 is a mask meaning &#8220;undefined&#8221;); it is, in
fact, the &#8220;.1&#8221; subnet.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Superblock</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>In Linux, partitions are discussed in terms of blocks. A block is 512 bytes. The
superblock is the first 512 bytes of a partition.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Supplemental disk</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>In Slackware, a floppy disk used during installation that contains neither the kernel
(which is on the boot disk) nor the root filesystem (which is on the root disk), but
additional needed files such as network modules or PCMCIA support.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Suspended process</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A process which has been frozen until killed or resumed.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Swap space</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Disk space used by the kernel as &#8220;virtual&#8221; RAM. It is slower than RAM, but
because disk space is cheaper, swap is usually more plentiful. Swap space is useful to
the kernel for holding lesser-used data and as a fallback when physical RAM is
exhausted.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Symbolic link</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A special file that simply points to the location of another file. Symbolic links are
used to avoid data duplication when a file is needed in multiple locations.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Tagfile</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A file used by the Slackware <tt class="COMMAND">setup</tt> program during
installation, which describes a set of packages to be installed.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Terminal</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A human-computer interface consisting of at least a screen (or virtual screen) and
some method of input (almost always at least a keyboard).</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Toolkit, GUI</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A GUI toolkit is a collection of libraries that provide a programmer with code to draw
&#8220;widgets&#8221; such as scrollbars, checkboxes, etc. and construct a graphical
interface. The GUI toolkit used by a program often defines its &#8220;look and
feel&#8221;.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>UID</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>User Identifier. A unique number that identifies a user to the system. UIDs are used
by most programs instead of usernames because a number is easier to deal with; usernames
are generally only used when the user has to see things happen.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>VESA</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Video Electronics Standards Association. The term &#8220;VESA&#8221; is often used to
denote a standard specified by said Association. Nearly all modern video adapters are
VESA-compliant.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Virtual terminal</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The use of software to simulate multiple terminals while using only a single set of
input/output devices (keyboard, monitor, mouse). Special keystrokes switch between
virtual terminals at a single physical terminal.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Window manager</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>An X program whose purpose is to provide a graphical interface beyond the simple
rectangle-drawing of the X Window System. Window managers generally provide titlebars,
menus for running programs, etc.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Working directory</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The directory in which a program considers itself to be while running.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Wrapper program</b></dt>
