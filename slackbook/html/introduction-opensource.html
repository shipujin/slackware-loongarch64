Source and Free Software</a></h1>

<p>Within the Linux community, there are two major ideological movements at work. The
Free Software movement (which we'll get into in a moment) is working toward the goal of
making all software free of intellectual property restrictions. Followers of this
movement believe these restrictions hamper technical improvement and work against the
good of the community. The Open Source movement is working toward most of the same goals,
but takes a more pragmatic approach to them. Followers of this movement prefer to base
their arguments on the economic and technical merits of making source code freely
available, rather than the moral and ethical principles that drive the Free Software
Movement.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum are groups that wish to maintain tighter controls
over their software.</p>

<p>The Free Software movement is headed by the Free Software Foundation, a fund-raising
organization for the GNU project. Free software is more of an ideology. The oft-used
expression is &#8220;free as in speech, not free as in beer&#8221;. In essence, free
software is an attempt to guarantee certain rights for both users and developers. These
freedoms include the freedom to run the program for any reason, to study and modify the
source code, to redistribute the source, and to share any modifications you make. In
order to guarantee these freedoms, the GNU General Public License (GPL) was created. The
GPL, in brief, provides that anyone distributing a compiled program which is licensed
under the GPL must also provide source code, and is free to make modifications to the
program as long as those modifications are also made available in source code form. This
guarantees that once a program is &#8220;opened&#8221; to the community, it cannot be
&#8220;closed&#8221; except by consent of every author of every piece of code (even the
modifications) within it. Most Linux programs are licensed under the GPL.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the GPL does not say anything about price. As odd as it
may sound, you can charge for free software. The &#8220;free&#8221; part is in the
liberties you have with the source code, not in the price you pay for the software.
(However, once someone has sold you, or even given you, a compiled program licensed under
the GPL they are obligated to provide its source code as well.)</p>

<p>Another popular license is the BSD license. In contrast to the GPL, the BSD license
gives no requirement for the release of a program's source code. Software released under
the BSD license allows redistribution in source or binary form provided only a few
conditions are met. The author's credentials cannot be used as a sort of advertisement
for the program. It also indemnifies the author from liability for damages that may arise
from the use of the software. Much of the software included in Slackware Linux is BSD
licensed.</p>

<p>At the forefront of the younger Open Source movement, the Open Source Initiative is an
organization that solely exists to gain support for open source software, that is,
software that has the source code available as well as the ready-to-run program. They do
not offer a specific license, but instead they support the various types of open source
licenses available.</p>

<p>The idea behind the OSI is to get more companies behind open source by allowing them
to write their own open source licenses and have those licenses certified by the Open
Source Initiative. Many companies want to release source code, but do not want to use the
GPL. Since they cannot radically change the GPL, they are offered the opportunity to
provide their own license and have it certified by this organization.</p>

<p>While the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative work to help each
other, they are not the same thing. The Free Software Foundation uses a specific license
and provides software under that license. The Open Source Initiative seeks support for
all open source licenses, including the one from the Free Software Foundation. The
grounds on which each argues for making source code freely available sometimes divides
the two movements, but the fact that two ideologically diverse groups are working toward
the same goal lends credence to the efforts of each.</p>
