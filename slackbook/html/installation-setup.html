<h1 class="SECT1"><a id="INSTALLATION-SETUP" name="INSTALLATION-SETUP">3.4 The <tt
class="COMMAND">setup</tt> Program</a></h1>

<p>Once you have created your partitions, you are ready to install Slackware. The next
step in the installation process is running the <tt class="COMMAND">setup</tt>(8)
program. To do so, simply type <tt class="COMMAND">setup</tt> at the shell prompt. <tt
class="COMMAND">setup</tt> is a menu-driven system for actually installing the Slackware
packages and configuring your system.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN981" name="AEN981"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-program-w.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>The setup process goes something like this: You step through each option in the <tt
class="COMMAND">setup</tt> program, in the order they are listed. (Of course, you are
free to do things in almost any order you choose, but chances are it isn't going to work
out very well.) Menu items are selected using the up and down arrow keys, and the
&#8220;Okay&#8221; and &#8220;Cancel&#8221; buttons can be chosen by using the left and
right arrow keys. Alternatively, each option has a corresponding key, which is
highlighted in the option name. Options which are flaggable (those indicated with a <var
class="LITERAL">[X]</var>) are toggled using the spacebar.</p>

<p>Of course, all of that is described in the &#8220;help&#8221; section of <tt
class="COMMAND">setup</tt>, but we believe in giving our readers their money's worth.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN993" name="AEN993">3.4.1 HELP</a></h2>

<p>If this is your first time installing Slackware, you might want to take a look at the
help screen. It will give a description of each part of <tt class="COMMAND">setup</tt>
(much like the one we're writing now, but less involved) and instructions for navigating
the rest of the install.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN997" name="AEN997"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-help-w.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1001" name="AEN1001">3.4.2 KEYMAP</a></h2>

<p>If you require a keymap other than the United States &#8220;qwerty&#8221; layout, you
may want to take a look at this section. It offers a number of alternate layouts for your
keyboarding enjoyment.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1009" name="AEN1009"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-keymap-w.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1013" name="AEN1013">3.4.3 ADDSWAP</a></h2>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1015" name="AEN1015"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-swap-w.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>If you created a swap partition (back in <a
href="installation-partitioning.html">Section 3.3</a>), this section will allow you to
enable it. It will autodetect and display the swap partitions on your hard drive,
allowing you to select one to format and enable.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1023" name="AEN1023">3.4.4 TARGET</a></h2>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1025" name="AEN1025"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-target-w.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>The target section is where your other (non-swap) partitions are formatted and mapped
to filesystem mount points. A list of the partitions on your hard disk will be displayed.
For each partition, you will be given the option of whether to format that partition or
not. Depending on the kernel used, you can choose between reiserfs (the default), ext3,
ext2, jfs, and xfs. Most people use either reiserfs or ext3. In the near future we may
see support for reiserfs4 slip in.</p>

<p>The first option in the target section is the selection of a partition on which to
install your root (<tt class="FILENAME">/</tt>) filesystem. After that, you will be able
to map other partitions to filesystems as you choose. (For instance, you may want your
third partition, say <tt class="FILENAME">/dev/hda3</tt>, to be your home filesystem.
This is just an example; map the partitions as you see fit.)</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1035" name="AEN1035">3.4.5 SOURCE</a></h2>

<p>The source section is where you select the source media from which you are installing
Slackware. Currently there are four sources to choose from. These are CD-ROM, NFS, or a
premounted directory.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1038" name="AEN1038"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-source-w.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>The CD-ROM selection enables a CD-ROM based installation. It will offer the option of
scanning for a CD-ROM drive or displaying a list from which you can pick your drive type.
Make sure you have the Slackware CD in your drive before allowing it to scan.</p>

<p>The NFS selection prompts for your network information and the network information for
your NFS server. The NFS server must be set up in advance. Also note that you cannot use
hostnames, you must use the IP addresses for both your machine and the NFS server (there
is no name resolver on the setup disk). Naturally you must have used the <tt
class="FILENAME">network.dsk</tt> floppy to add support for your network controller.</p>

<p>The premounted directory offers the most flexibility. You can use this method to
install from things such as Jaz disks, NFS mounts over PLIP, and FAT filesystems. Mount
the filesystem to a location of your choosing before running setup, then specify that
location here.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1054" name="AEN1054">3.4.6 SELECT</a></h2>

<p>The select option allows you to select the software series that you wish to install.
These series are described in <a
href="installation-requirements.html#INSTALLATION-SOFTWARE-SERIES">Section 3.2.1</a>.
Please note that you must install the A series to have a working base system. All other
series are optional.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1058" name="AEN1058"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-select-w.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1062" name="AEN1062">3.4.7 INSTALL</a></h2>

<p>Assuming that you have gone through the &#8220;target&#8221;, &#8220;source&#8221;,
and &#8220;select&#8221; options, the <var class="OPTION">install</var> option will allow
you to select packages from your chosen software series. If not, it will prompt you to go
back and complete the other sections of the setup program. This option allows you to
select from six different installation methods: <var class="OPTION">full</var>, <var
class="OPTION">newbie</var>, <var class="OPTION">menu</var>, <var
class="OPTION">expert</var>, <var class="OPTION">custom</var>, and <var
class="OPTION">tag path</var>.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1077" name="AEN1077"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-install-w.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>The <var class="OPTION">full</var> option will install every package from all the
software series that you chose in the &#8220;select&#8221; section. There is no further
prompting. This is the easiest installation method, since you do not need to make any
decisions on the actual packages to install. Of course, this option also takes up the
most hard drive space.</p>

<p>The next option is <var class="OPTION">newbie</var>. This option installs all of the
required packages in the selected series. For all other packages, it offers a prompt
where you can select &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221;, or &#8220;Skip&#8221;. Yes and
No do the obvious, while Skip will go ahead to the next software series. Additionally,
you will see a description and size requirement for each package to help you decide if
you need it. We recommend this option for new users, as it ensures that you get all the
required packages installed. However, it is a little slow because of the prompting.</p>

<p><var class="OPTION">Menu</var> is a faster and more advanced version of the newbie
option. For each series, a menu is displayed, from which you can select all the
non-required packages you want to install. Required packages are not displayed on this
menu.</p>

<p>For the more advanced user, install offers the <var class="OPTION">expert</var>
option. This allows you complete control over what packages get installed. You can
deselect packages that are absolutely required, resulting in a broken system. On the
other hand, you can control exactly what goes onto your system. Simply select the
packages from each series that you want installed. This is not recommended for the new
user, as it is quite easy to shoot yourself in the foot.</p>

<p>The <var class="OPTION">custom</var> and <var class="OPTION">tag path</var> options
are also for advanced users. These options allow you to install based upon custom tag
files that you created in the distribution tree. This is useful for installing to large
numbers of machines fairly quickly. For more information on using tag files, see <a
href="package-management-making-tags-and-tagfiles.html">Section 18.4</a>.</p>

<p>After selecting your installation method, one of a few things will happen. If you
selected full or menu, a menu screen will appear, allowing you to select the packages to
be installed. If you selected full, packages will immediately start getting installed to
the target. If you selected newbie, packages will be installed until an optional package
is reached.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to run out of space while installing. If you selected too
many packages for the amount of free space on the target device, you will have problems.
The safest thing to do is to select some software and add more later, if you need it.
This can easily be done using Slackware's package management tools. For this information,
see <a href="package-management.html">Chapter 18</a>.</p>

<div class="SECT2">
<h2 class="SECT2"><a id="AEN1100" name="AEN1100">3.4.8 CONFIGURE</a></h2>

<p>The configure section allows you to do some basic system configuration, now that the
packages have been installed. What you see here depends in large part upon which software
you have installed. You will, however, always see the following:</p>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1103" name="AEN1103">3.4.8.1 Kernel selection</a></h3>

<p>Here you will be asked to select a kernel to install. You can install the kernel from
the boot disk you used to install, the Slackware CD-ROM, or from another floppy which you
(always thinking ahead) have prepared. Or you can elect to skip, in which case the
default kernel will be installed and play will continue to the dealer's left.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1106" name="AEN1106"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-kernel-w.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1110" name="AEN1110">3.4.8.2 Make a boot disk</a></h3>

<p>Making a boot disk for future use is probably a good idea. You will have the option of
formatting a floppy and then creating one of two types of boot disk. The first type, <var
class="OPTION">simple</var>, simply (go figure) writes a kernel to the floppy. A more
flexible (and highly recommended) option is <var class="OPTION">lilo</var>, which will of
course create a lilo boot disk. See LILO in <a href="booting.html#BOOTING-LILO">Section
7.1</a> for more information. Of course, you may also choose to simply <var
class="LITERAL">continue</var>, in which case no boot disk will be made.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1119" name="AEN1119"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-bootdisk-w.png" /></p>

</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1123" name="AEN1123">3.4.8.3 Modem</a></h3>

<p>You will be prompted for modem information. More specifically, you will be asked
whether you have a modem, and if so, what serial port it is on.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1128" name="AEN1128"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-modem-w.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>These next configuration subsections may or may not appear, depending on whether or
not you installed their corresponding packages.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1133" name="AEN1133">3.4.8.4 Timezone</a></h3>

<p>This one's pretty straightforward: you will be asked what time zone you are in. If you
operate on Zulu time, we are very sorry; the (extremely long) list is alphabetically
ordered, and you're at the bottom.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1138" name="AEN1138"></a>

</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1142" name="AEN1142">3.4.8.5 Mouse</a></h3>

<p>This subsection simply asks what kind of mouse you have, and whether you want <tt
class="COMMAND">gpm</tt>(8) console mouse support enabled on bootup.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1148" name="AEN1148"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-mouse-w.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1152" name="AEN1152">3.4.8.6 Hardware clock</a></h3>

<p>This subsection asks if your computer's hardware clock is set to Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC or GMT). Most PCs are not, so you should probably say no.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1159" name="AEN1159">3.4.8.7 Font</a></h3>

<p>The font subsection allows you to choose from a list of custom console fonts.</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1164" name="AEN1164"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-font-w.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1168" name="AEN1168">3.4.8.8 LILO</a></h3>

<p>Here you are prompted for installation of LILO (the LInux LOader; see <a
href="booting.html#BOOTING-LILO">Section 7.1</a> for more information).</p>

<div class="INFORMALFIGURE"><a id="AEN1174" name="AEN1174"></a>
<p><img src="installation/setup-lilo-w.png" /></p>
</div>

<p>If Slackware is to be the only operating system on your computer, <var
class="OPTION">simple</var> should work just fine for you. If you are dual-booting, the
<var class="OPTION">expert</var> option is a better choice. See <a
href="booting-dual.html">Section 7.3</a> for more information on dual-booting. The third
option, <var class="OPTION">do not install</var>, is not recommended unless you know what
you're doing and have a very good reason for not installing LILO. If you are performing
an expert install, you will be given a choice as to where LILO will be put. You may place
LILO in the MBR (Master Boot Record) of your hard drive, in the superblock of your root
Linux partition, or on a floppy disk.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1183" name="AEN1183">3.4.8.9 Network</a></h3>

<p>The network configuration subsection is actually <tt class="COMMAND">netconfig</tt>.
See <a href="network-configuration.html#NETWORK-CONFIGURATION-NETCONFIG">Section 5.1</a>
for more information.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECT3">
<h3 class="SECT3"><a id="AEN1190" name="AEN1190">3.4.8.10 X Window Manager</a></h3>

<p>This subsection will allow you to choose a default window manager for X. See <a

</div>

<p>No matter which packages you installed, the last thing configure will do is ask you
whether you want to go ahead and set a <tt class="USERNAME">root</tt> password. For
security reasons, this is probably a good idea; however, like almost everything else in
Slackware, this is your call.</p>
