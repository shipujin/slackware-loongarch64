Slackware 14.1 x86_64 stable is released!

It's been another interesting release cycle here at Slackware bringing
new features like support for UEFI machines, updated compilers and
development tools, the switch from MySQL to MariaDB, and many more
improvements throughout the system.  Thanks to the team, the upstream
developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else who
pitched in to help make this release a reality.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Have fun!  :-)

Here are a few more updates and bugfixes.  The small networking utilities
should be safe upgrades (thanks to Luiz Gustavo).  I'd thought about Samba
4.1 before the rc (and some more afterwards), and after testing it here
without any issues decided we should try it out.  The Samba project is
known for very high quality releases, so I don't believe we'll be stung by
a .0 version here.  The kernels were rebuilt to fix a regression that
occurred when the 3.10.0 kernel changed CONFIG_PARAVIRT_GUEST to
CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST, which caused some previously included VMWare and
Hyper-V drivers to not be built.  These are the changed kernel options:
   HYPERVISOR_GUEST n -> y
  +FB_HYPERV n
  +HID_HYPERV_MOUSE m
  +HYPERV m
  +HYPERV_BALLOON m
  +HYPERV_NET m
  +HYPERV_STORAGE m
  +HYPERV_UTILS m
  +PARAVIRT n
  +VMWARE_BALLOON m
  +XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST n
Thanks to Victor Miasnikov for the bug report.

And with this batch of updates and fixes (clearing the rest of the
important stuff from the TODO list), we have arrived at Slackware 14.1
release candidate 1!  Please test and report any remaining issues.
UEFI (with the exception of Secure Boot, which will have to wait until
we have real hardware) should be fully implemented in the installer now,
which will detect and warn about common problems, set up the EFI System
Partition under /boot/efi, and install ELILO and a UEFI boot entry
automatically.  There's a new README_UEFI.TXT file with detailed 
instructions for installing 64-bit Slackware on UEFI (32-bit won't
support native UEFI due to the mismatch between 64-bit UEFI firmware and
a 32-bit kernel, so Legacy BIOS will be the only way to install 32-bit
Slackware on UEFI).  Several useful netfilter and networking utilities
have been added (thanks to Robby Workman and /dev/rob0 for these).
With this batch of updates, everything should be considered frozen
(including the kernel) unless there's a good reason to change something.
Enjoy!  See you all for the release, hopefully soon.  :-)

  If the hardware clock is kept in localtime, save the time to the hardware
  clock after starting ntpd.  This prevents the kernel from saving the system
  time to the hardware clock every 11 minutes, which would cause the hardware

UEFI boot of the ISO image should be working now!  See the new instructions
for mastering the ISO in isolinux/README.TXT.  Thanks to Patrick Verner,
Steven Shiau, and jtsn for confirming my findings about how to get GRUB to
search for the disc after a UEFI El-Torito boot.  Also, a new source option
has been added to the installer (install the packages from a USB stick).  The
packages are expected to be found in /slackware64-$VERSION/slackware64/, or
/slackware64/.  The usbimg2disk.sh script has been slightly modified since
it no longer needs to make changes to the installer.  There's still no
automatic bootloader installation for UEFI, but we'll look into setting up
elilo there.  Adding a UEFI boot menu entry will probably be left as an
exercise for the end user.  Test it, but I think it's finally working.  :-)

EFI/BOOT/*:  Switch from elilo to GRUB for UEFI ISO boot.  Bring up a menu that
  offers to start the installer with or without the KMS console since it seems
  that under UEFI some cards require KMS, while others won't work if KMS is
  active.  Also, provide an option to scan for and offer to boot operating
  systems that are installed already.  This works here on VirtualBox, but I'd
  like to get some feedback from people who have real UEFI machines.  My
  understanding is that newer UEFI firmwares do support ISO9660 filesystems
  and this should work on those.  Older machines may still require a USB
  stick to boot the installer.

a/efibootmgr-0.5.4-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Well, reverted to an older version really.  :)  It was reported that
  efibootmgr-0.6.0 was silently failing to actually write the new variables
  to EFI, but that 0.5.4 works.  I'm currently unable to test this here as I'm
  still using DUET UEFI, and changes to the UEFI variables do not persist
  between boots.  I also added a few patches from Fedora's repo that seem
  reasonable to include.  The old (newer) version was moved to /testing in
  case it might work better for someone.

  Patched to remove pt_chown.  Thanks to mancha.
  Note that while this patches CVE-2013-2207 (a local privilege escalation
  vulnerability), the vulnerability depends upon insecure and non-default
  settings ("user_allow_other" in /etc/fuse.conf) and the patch is not
  trivial to port to older versions of glibc.  For older versions, the
  best approach is to not set that option in fuse.conf, as it likely opens
  up other holes as well.  Another approach to mitigate this is to make
  pt_chown a symlink to /bin/true, as the kernel has handled chowning
  pseudo terminals for a long time and pt_chown isn't needed at all.

Looks like 3.10.x got LTS status, but more importantly fixes the power issue
on resume with some Intel machines.  So, we're bumping the kernel to 3.10.5,
and will stick with that series for the release.  A few more things to look at
before calling this a beta, but it's pretty close.  Enjoy!

  Switched back to dhcpcd instead of dhclient as the default DHCP client in
  the NetworkManager.conf file.  Either one will work, but it's probably
  better to use dhcpcd by default to avoid a nasty surprise for people who
  didn't install the dhcp package since they aren't running a DHCP server.

  After rebuilding this package, several config files had numerous blank
  lines at the beginning.  I suspected the new version of gawk, but reverting
  to the version from Slackware 14.0 didn't help.  So, we'll use awk to strip
  these before building the package.  If anyone knows why this is happening,
  I'd be interested to know what the real fix is rather than just papering
  over the problem.  Thanks to BroX for the bug report.

More updates...  thanks to Robby Workman for help on many of these, and also
for updating README_RAID.TXT for a few changes to mdadm's configuration.
We've tested the new RAID instructions here, but given our familiarity with
the process it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a few more eyes looking for
bugs.  If you find any, let us know.  Enjoy!  :)

After careful consideration and a lot of testing as the 3.9.x kernel series
has progressed, we have decided to move to the latest kernel.  It should be
a nice improvement over 3.8.13, which as you all know has reached EOL (at
kernel.org anyway...  I do know about Ubuntu's git maintained version).
After the last experience with upgrading 14.0 to a newer LTS kernel, I can't
say that I have too much faith in the idea that LTS kernels can be upgraded
without causing any regressions.  If the kernel we're using in -current
happens to be delared an LTS kernel, sure, that's a nice plus, but I don't
think it's worth rolling all the way back to 3.4.x just to have an LTS kernel.
Anyway, test it out and report any issues!

  This is a bugfix release.  It also fixes a security issue -- a heap-based
  overflow in the quoted_printable_encode() function, which could be used by
  a remote attacker to crash PHP or execute code as the 'apache' user.

  Background the udev hp-config_usb_printer process to avoid long delays.
  Thanks to timkb4cq.
ap/vim-7.3.1087-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Vim patch 7.0.88 rewrote the regexp engine.  Unfortunately the new
  implementation was causing long delays of 10 seconds or more when opening or
  scrolling any file of a type for which vim does color syntax highlighting.
  Patch 7.3.1110 attempted to fix this, and more patches released today
  correct other bugs in this new regexp engine (including patch 7.3.1111 which
  doesn't even fully apply correctly).  Even with all the fixes applied, the
  new engine is grossly inefficient when compared with the old one, and it is
  obvious that vim is running much more slowly even on my fastest machine.
  It seems like the best course of action is to take all the patches before
  the one that changed the regexp engine and then give upstream some time to
  figure this all out.  Thanks to Benjamin Trigona-Harany for the bug report.
l/libffi-3.0.13-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to move the ffi include files back to /usr/include, and patched
  the pkgconfig file to point there as well.  The relocation of the include
  files to be outside of /usr/include worked for programs that used
  pkgconfig, but there are many programs that do not and this change broke
  compiling them.  Thanks to gmgf.

x/wqy-zenhei-font-ttf-0.8.38_1-noarch-2.txz:  Upgraded.
  The package reverts to the 0.8.38 version due to reports that the newer
  version causes rendering issues with Japanese and Korean fonts.  I've
  found many references to this issue online, and have yet to see any
  solution for it besides reverting or removing the wqy-zenhei-font-ttf
  package altogether.  Some people have suggested dropping wqy-zenhei in
  favor of Droid Sans Fallback, but the glyph coverage is not as good with
  that font.  Probably the best solution for now is to go back to the
  version that seems to work (with a patch to the .conf file for
  compatibility with recent versions of fontconfig).

Hey folks, a few more updates are ready.  I'd like to thank everyone who
weighed in on the thread on LQ concerning reverting a few things to more
stable versions.  Your opinions were very helpful.  Here's what was
concluded after careful consideration:
1) kernel:  Stick with 3.8 for now.  It remains a concern that the nVidia
6150SE and nouveau could be broken with kernels above 3.6.1, however.
Does anyone know if the blob fixes the issues?  If not, there may still be
a compelling reason to switch to the 3.4 kernel for the release.  The
release of the 3.9 kernel might be another reason as well, since moving to
a newer branch could bring more problems and would basically require testing
to start again at square one (and then the 3.8 branch would be dead).  But
since we're sticking with 3.8 for now, might as well bump it to 3.8.8.
2) gcc:  I really have not run into any compiler bugs with this.  There was
a single report of issues with the radeon R300 when the kernel was compiled
with 4.8.0, and it wasn't reported on any bug trackers or anywhere else.
None of the other reports of issues could be reproduced here, or were merely
a case of getting rid of -Werror.  I see no reason to downgrade this.
3) xorg-server:  Here, it does appear that going with the better supported
branch (1.13.x) is a good idea to help support external drivers.  Many
people reported when the batch containing 1.14.0 was shipped that things were
working better, but I attribute this to the driver updates that went out at
the same time.  I've moved the 1.14.x (upgraded to 1.14.1) server and the
drivers that were build against it into testing, so anyone that wants to use
that branch is free to continue to do so.  But I think that the average user
is more likely to run into problems with the 1.14.x branch and the lack of
driver support from AMD than they are to require one of the improvements such
as in the area of touch input support.
Thanks again for the advice!

  Patched two crash bugs (CVE-2013-0242, CVE-2013-1914).  These do not allow
  code execution, and upstream agrees that they are low priority/severity.
  They are patched here since glibc was due for a kernel related rebuild
  anyway, but given the low priority/severity and possibility of introducing
  problems in production versions of glibc, they will backported only if
  further review indicates a necessity.

  doesn't do anything unless it has been configured it should be safe to
  include.

Some more X updates from upstream.  Also, several video drivers that didn't
fail to compile were found to still be using the obsolete and removed
miInitializeBackingStore() function.  One of them was the s3virge driver
that was reported on LQ to not be working...  perhaps it works now?

a/shadow-4.1.4.3-x86_64-8.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched pw_encrypt() to fix "crypt:  Invalid argument" and immediate login
  failure when a non-existent user tries to log in.  This was caused by a
  change in the behavior of glibc's crypt() function.  When a user that does
  not exist tries to log in, the code in shadow calls crypt() with an invalid
  salt.  The old version of crypt() used the provided bad salt (always "!")
  to produce a DES hash with "!!" at the beginning, while the new one just
  returns NULL which isn't well-handled by the shadow code.  To fix this
  shadow bug, if the salt is invalid, we'll call crypt() using a good SHA512
  salt, prepend "!!" to the hash that we get back, and have pw_encrypt()
  return this as the result.  The effect is identical to the previous
  behavior -- unless the exact same malformed hash happens to be the hash in
  /etc/shadow (it won't be), the login will fail.  While I see no way that
  these 6 lines of code could be less secure than the original code, I
  welcome additional review.  Also, if anyone spots anything else that was
  adversely affected by the change to crypt()'s behavior, please let me know.
  Thanks to Michael L. Semon for informing me of the /bin/login problem.

More updates, and several rebuilds due to bumped library versions in
the boost, icu4c, ilmbase, imagemagick, libzip, and net-snmp packages.
Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger for several of these library bumps, and to
Robby Workman for the initial work on lots of the updates in this batch.
The big news here is the removal of MySQL in favor of MariaDB.  This
shouldn't really be a surprise on any level.  The poll on LQ showed a large
majority of our users were in favor of the change.  It's my belief that
the MariaDB Foundation will do a better job with the code, be more
responsive to security concerns, and be more willing to work with the
open source community.  And while I don't think there is currently any
issue with MySQL's licensing of the community edition for commercial uses,
several threads on LQ showed that there is confusion about this, whereas
with MariaDB the freedom to use the software is quite clear.  Thanks are
due to Heinz Wiesinger for his work on transitioning the build script,
testing, and getting us all behind this move.  He's been working with
MariaDB (and their developers) for several years now.  Vincent Batts also
had a hand in the early discussions here -- he met Daniel Bartholomew of
MariaDB on a train last year and got a copy of the source to play with to
pass the time on the journey (ah, the miracle of thumbdrives :), and was
impressed with not only MariaDB itself, but also with the welcome that
Slackware was getting.  We expect they'll be responsive to any concerns
we have.  In the vast majority of situations, MariaDB is entirely
compatible with existing MySQL databases and will drop right in with no
changes required.  There's an article available outlining the areas in
which MariaDB differs from MySQL that I'd recommend reading:
  https://kb.askmonty.org/v/mariadb-versus-mysql-compatibility/
Thanks to the MariaDB Foundation!  We look forward to working with you.

EFI/BOOT/*:  Added.
  I am hearing that more recent versions of UEFI *do* support the ISO9660
  filesystem, and that just putting this directory on the ISO image will
  make the disc bootable.  I do not have a real UEFI machine, but I made an
  ISO (instructions in isolinux/README.TXT) and it boots here on VirtualBox.

usb-and-pxe-installers/usbboot.img:  Rebuilt.
  Added /EFI/BOOT/ directory containing elilo.
  Thanks to Erik_FL on LQ for pointing out that a boot image for UEFI did not
  need to have a GPT partition table.  Seems it works either way, but since
  GPT is not required that allows us to add the support for UEFI boot to the
  regular USB installer image.  Unfortunately, this image still does not
  work any better (or differently) as an El-Torito boot image for EFI on
  an ISO.  In tests here, elilo loads but runs into an error while loading
  the initrd.  I've experimented with different -boot-load-size options
  (including way too large to be sure the whole image is mapped) but so
  far it has not worked.  If anyone figures out the trick to making this work,
  let me know.  It would be nice to have the DVD bootable under UEFI, and it
  wouldn't take any extra space since the usbboot.img file will be on the
  disc anyway.

Here we go with some more updates...  a few notes on them are in order.
For this kernel update I decided to go with 3.7.10.  Yeah, the 3.7 series
is EOL, but I've heard about some broken drivers in 3.8.x that make me
hesitate to push forward.  Another option might be to move to 3.4.x, which
is working on my machine finally (a clocksource bug was crashing it with
earlier versions).  The USB host and usb-storage drivers are now modular
in both the huge and generic kernels to avoid an issue where a USB stick
could be assigned /dev/sda when running the huge kernel.  The brcmsmac
driver for Broadcom wifi is built.  However, this takes over for any
Broadcom card that it can support -- those cards will no longer be supported
by the b43 driver.  So, if you're currently using b43 and find that it no
longer works, you'll need to move to the brcmsmac driver instead.  It's
technically possible to build these with the overlapping support, but it's
a mess that way which is probably why nobody else is doing that.  And finally,
rudimentary UEFI support makes its first appearance in -current in the form
of a bootable USB image called efiboot.img.  Still no support in the
installer for setting up elilo, but this will at least get Linux installed
without the need for Legacy BIOS support.  Looking into how to set up the
boot support in the installer will be the next order of business, and I
have a few different ideas about the way to go about that...  probably
some good material for a discussion on LQ.  BTW, a GPT FAT image like this
one is _supposed_ to work as an El-Torito alternate boot image when creating
an ISO image (extra mkisofs options: -eltorito-alt-boot -no-emul-boot
-eltorito-platform 0xEF -eltorito-boot usb-and-pxe-installers/efiboot.img),
but it's mostly not working here.  I did get one of these to work when booted
from an ISO, but all the attempts after that failed.  Looks like it might be
a problem with the -boot-load-size being detected properly for one magic
EFI image and not for all the others.  If anyone is brave or bored enough to
look into that, hints are gratefully accepted.  Anyway, that's it for now.
Have fun!

  Actually, dropping back from 5.01, which has a bug that prevents extra

isolinux/initrd.img:  Rebuilt.
  This adds support for kernel mode setting video, needed to have any text
  output with some UEFI implementations.  If you need to bypass this, use
  the "nomodeset" option at the boot prompt.
  Terminus fonts were added to avoid small KMS text (bypass with "nofont").
  USB host and usb-storage modules were added since those are no longer built
  into the huge kernels.
  The hv_storvsc.ko module was added to support installing in Hyper-V.

usb-and-pxe-installers/efiboot.img:  Added.
  This is a USB installer image that can be booted from UEFI.

Lots of X updates in this batch!  We were finally able to upgrade to the
latest cairo (including the long-requested XCB backend), as the text
corruption bug that was preventing that was fixed in the upstream X server.
We've also upgraded to the latest libdrm and Mesa.  Don't miss the new glu
package -- that was previously part of Mesa, and there are a lot of things
that link to it.  Thanks to Robby Workman for all the help with this.

  Pidgin developers are.  Third times the charm?

  This addresses the flaw in CBC record processing discovered by
  Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson. Details of this attack can be found
  at: http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/
  Thanks go to Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson of the Information
  Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London
  (www.isg.rhul.ac.uk) for discovering this flaw and Adam Langley and
  Emilia Käsper for the initial patch.

  [Emilia Käsper, Adam Langley, Ben Laurie, Andy Polyakov, Steve Henson]
    Fix flaw in AESNI handling of TLS 1.2 and 1.1 records for CBC mode
  ciphersuites which can be exploited in a denial of service attack.
  Thanks go to and to Adam Langley <agl@chromium.org> for discovering
  and detecting this bug and to Wolfgang Ettlinger
  <wolfgang.ettlinger@gmail.com> for independently discovering this issue.
  (CVE-2012-2686)

  Upgraded to SDL-1.2.15, SDL_image-1.2.12, SDL_mixer-1.2.12,
  SDL_net-1.2.8, and SDL_ttf-2.0.11.
  Patched resizing and mouse clicking bugs.
n/curl-7.29.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  When negotiating SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication, the function
  Curl_sasl_create_digest_md5_message() uses the data provided from the
  server without doing the proper length checks and that data is then
  appended to a local fixed-size buffer on the stack.  This vulnerability
  can be exploited by someone who is in control of a server that a libcurl
  based program is accessing with POP3, SMTP or IMAP.  For applications
  that accept user provided URLs, it is also thinkable that a malicious
  user would feed an application with a URL to a server hosting code
  targeting this flaw.
  Affected versions: curl 7.26.0 to and including 7.28.1

a/udev-182-x86_64-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  The upgrade to the 3.7.1 kernel broke the generation of persistent optical
  device rules, and existing rules in 70-persistent-cd.rules no longer worked.
  This update fixes the issue by basing the rules on ID_SERIAL rather than
  ID_PATH (which is not supported by the new kernel's libata transport class).
  After upgrading the package, remove /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules
  and reboot the machine.  This will create a working rules file and restore
  the expected symbolic links to optical devices in /dev.
x/xf86-input-vmmouse-12.9.0-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Replaced the HAL config files with udev rules.  Thanks to Tomas M.
xap/gucharmap-3.4.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Install the doinst.sh header properly, and use chroot to run
  update-desktop-database and glib-compile-schemas to insure the package is
  installed correctly during an initial installation.
  Thanks to David Gabriel Rodriguez Castillo and Matteo Bernardini.

  I'm not sure how this behaves with the X.Org/Mesa stuff that uses llvm, but
  we can cross that bridge when we get to it.  We were due for an update here
  anyway, and can't very well just let LLVM/Clang sit broken in -current.

  In addition, the build script has been moved from using ./configure back
  to .mozconfig in order to build with profile-guided optimization by default.
  The script itself parses ./configure like syntax for ease of hacking.
  Better icons in more resolutions are installed as well.
  Thanks much to Matteo Bernardini for the improvements!

Every time the world is about to end, all I want to do is compile kernels.
So, here you go...  the final kernel updates. *
Still testing the new glibc, which removes the gets() function and may or may
not be a safe upgrade yet.  It might be safer after the next gcc comes out.

+--------------------------+
Tue Dec 11 22:35:02 UTC 2012
a/mkinitrd-1.4.7-x86_64-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added support for the parameter names that control the delay before
  attempting to mount the root filesystem, and the root file system type:
  'rootdelay' 'rootfstype' respectively.  These are the official/documented
  parameters in the kernel documentation.  The original parameters ('rootfs'
  and 'waitforroot') may still be used.
  Thanks to Thorsten Mühlfelder and Richard Lapointe for the suggestion.
  For ARM devices: unless specified when the initrd is built, or at boot
  time as a kernel parameter, wait a minimum of four seconds for the root
  device to become ready.
  Thanks to Jerome Pinot for the suggestion and the patch.

  Patched a heap-based buffer underflow in the xmlParseAttValueComplex

  remote attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute

Slackware 14.0 x86_64 stable is released!

We're perfectionists here at Slackware, so this release has been a long
time a-brewing.  But we think you'll agree that it was worth the wait.
Slackware 14.0 combines modern components, ease of use, and flexible
configuration... our "KISS" philosophy demands it.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen.  The Slackware team, the
upstream developers, and (of course) the awesome Slackware user community.

Have fun!  :-)
