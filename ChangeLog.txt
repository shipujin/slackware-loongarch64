  rc.S: fix_errors when mounting a bcachefs filesystem. Thanks to 0XBF.
l/glibc-2.40-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  On 32-bit, add these compile flags:
  -mstackrealign
  This is needed for compatibility with old binaries, thanks to iive.
  -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer
  Without these, both nouveau and the nvidia driver are prone to crashes and
  hangs. Thanks to UnrelatedMicrowave.
  On both 32-bit and 64-bit, add --enable-multi-arch. This will enable
  optimized assembly code within glibc, depending on the CPU detected.
  Thanks to iive.
  With -mstackrealign and --enable-multi-arch on 32-bit, I believe that
  -march= could be set to any x86 arch -- it's merely a decoration.

a/grub-2.12-x86_64-15.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In /etc/default/grub, eliminate the GRUB_DISABLE_KERNEL_SYMLINKS="true"
  option, replacing it with GRUB_DISPLAY_KERNEL_FILETYPES=both. This may
  be set to "symlinks" (only show kernel symlinks in the menu), "files"
  (only show kernel files in the menu), or "both" to show both.
  Thanks to 0XBF.
  In /etc/default/grub, add a new option GRUB_INITRD_FALLBACK_NAME=initrd.gz.
  This defines the name of an initrd that will match to any kernel if a
  better match wasn't found first. This option will be commented out by
  default.
  When the defaults in /etc/default/grub are left alone, the behavior of the
  10_linux script is identical to the unmodified one.

Well folks, we have some more interesting stuff in /testing now.
Our good friend LuckyCyborg posted a while back about our trials with
GRUB2, and that we were banging our heads against a wall for no reason
trying to bend GRUB2 with our 09_slackware_linux grub.d script instead
of changing our kernel/initrd naming scheme to vmlinuz-6.10.1-generic
and initrd-6.10.1-generic.img. And, as is often the case, our friend is
exactly correct. Once we stopped trying to swim against the current, GRUB2
started behaving as it should.
The updates in /testing change the kernel naming scheme thusly, and modify
the geninitrd script in the mkinitrd package to also use this naming
scheme. And, of course, 09_slackware_linux is removed from GRUB2, and the
10_linux script is only lightly modified.
Because lilo and elilo work with the symlinks to the kernel and initrd,
they shouldn't care anout this change.
We've probably got 6.9.11 coming tomorrow. Unless I hear that I should stop
the presses on this change, it's likely that those kernels will be updated
using the new naming scheme and the mkinitrd and grub updates will be moved
into the main tree from /testing.
We'll stick with 6.9 in the main tree for now because I'm still encountering
suspend failure with the 6.10 kernel here.
Enjoy! :-)

  qctx-zversion was not being cleared when it should have been leading to
  an assertion failure if it needed to be reused.
  An excessively large number of rrtypes per owner can slow down database query
  processing, so a limit has been placed on the number of rrtypes that can be
  stored per owner (node) in a cache or zone database. This is configured with
  the new "max-rrtypes-per-name" option, and defaults to 100.
  Excessively large rdatasets can slow down database query processing, so a
  limit has been placed on the number of records that can be stored per
  rdataset in a cache or zone database. This is configured with the new
  "max-records-per-type" option, and defaults to 100.
  Malicious DNS client that sends many queries over TCP but never reads
  responses can cause server to respond slowly or not respond at all for other

  Adjust compiler flags to what will likely be our new standard.
  Qt6 requires newer opcodes than -march=i586, and enough things have begun
  to include SSE2 instructions (without providing configure flags to opt-out)
  that trying to retain compatibility with CPUs from the 1990s just isn't
  going to work any more. My apologies if this causes your antique computer
  to get illegal instruction errors, but the solution will have to be sourcing
  an antique operating system for it.
  On 64-bit we will make the compiler flags for -march and -mtune explicit.

  Apply patches to fix CVEs that were fixed by the 1.1.1{x,y,za} releases that
  were only available to subscribers to OpenSSL's premium extended support.
  These patches were prepared by backporting commits from the OpenSSL-3.0 repo.
  The reported version number has been updated so that vulnerability scanners
  calm down. All of these issues were considered to be of low severity.
  We probably won't keep 1.1.1 in -current for long anyway, but might as well
  patch it first. :-)
  Thanks to Ken Zalewski for the patches!

  As upstream refactors this into smaller binaries, we could easily run into
  another update that causes an sshd lockout if the listener process isn't
  restarted. So, let's try to prevent that. After the package is upgraded,
  we'll use "sshd -t" to make sure that we have a sane configuration, and if
  so then we'll restart the listener process automatically.
  If you don't like this idea, you may turn it off in /etc/default/sshd.

  This update fixes security issues:
   Recursive clones on case-insensitive filesystems that support symbolic
   links are susceptible to case confusion that can be exploited to
   execute just-cloned code during the clone operation.
   Repositories can be configured to execute arbitrary code during local
   clones. To address this, the ownership checks introduced in v2.30.3
   are now extended to cover cloning local repositories.
   Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's
   object database when source and target repository reside on the same
   disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then
   those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the
   untrusted user.
   When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the
   filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files
   on the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/
   directory.
   It is supposed to be safe to clone untrusted repositories, even those
   unpacked from zip archives or tarballs originating from untrusted
   sources, but Git can be tricked to run arbitrary code as part of the
   clone.

  This seemed like a good opportunity to go over my notes and try to make this
  SlackBuild at least defensible, if not correct. :-) The non-wide libraries
  have all been purged and replaced with compatibility symlinks pointing to the
  wide versions. Anything trying to use -lncurses (etc) will be redirected to
  -lncursesw (etc) at compile time. Looks like nearly 50 packages are linked to
  the non-wide libraries, but everything works this way.

extra/emacs-regular-build/emacs-29.3-x86_64-2_regular.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This is a bugfix release.
  Only build the X11/GTK+3 version. Use "emacs -nw" if you want to start it
  in a terminal emulator in text mode, or rebuild if you really need to get
  rid of the X11 dependency for some reason.
  Build using --with-pdumper=auto. It seems that --with-dumping=unexec produces
  a buggy Emacs here in the modern era, with symptoms such as "child signal FD:
  Invalid argument". It's possible this had something to do with the reported
  memory leaks as well.
  Thanks to 3Tom for the bug report.

  OK, this is looking good enough to return to the main tree now.
  Thanks to hamkg, ctrlaltca, and rizitis for helping to debug the sleep issues
  with upstream, and to Sven Eden for the upstream fixes. I've changed the
  default sleep mode from s2idle to deep as s2idle still locks up most of the
  systems I've tried it on. Eventually we'll probably have to swallow this pill
  though (more notes on that in the SlackBuild).
  It didn't seem like recompiling polkit again was necessary, but correct me if
  I'm wrong about that.

  All right, it's time to stop the bleeding (edge). This has been verified as
  the last working version of elogind, so we'll revert for now while moving the
  newer sources into /testing. We didn't actually *need* the 255 branch for
  libgudev (I was mistakenly under that impression), so this will be fine for
  now. We'll keep an eye on upstream and move forward when things settle down.

  Build with meson instead of autotools, since setting session_tracking to

  While this didn't seem to make a difference in practice, better to get this
  right now and rule it out as part of the issue.

a/less-653-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This update patches a security issue:
  less through 653 allows OS command execution via a newline character in the
  name of a file, because quoting is mishandled in filename.c. Exploitation
  typically requires use with attacker-controlled file names, such as the files
  extracted from an untrusted archive. Exploitation also requires the LESSOPEN
  environment variable, but this is set by default in many common cases.

  (* Security fix *)
n/nghttp2-1.61.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  nghttp2 library keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION
  frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync. This
  causes excessive CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates
  this vulnerability by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it can
  accept after a HEADERS frame.

Everything in this batch besides aaa_libraries, xz, mcelog, and harfbuzz is a
rebuild or upgrade to build against python-3.11.8. Looking at the python
readiness page, it seems like a lot of stuff we use is not certified for
python-3.12 yet (although to be fair, about half as much isn't certified for
python-3.11 either). But 3.11 seems to be the safer choice even though the
final bugfix update is scheduled for Monday. And, if we do decide to move
ahead to 3.12 later on, it'll be a lot easier than this update was.
Enjoy! :-)

  Seems like a good idea to build this from a git pull rather than the signed
  release tarballs. :-)
  The liblzma in the previous packages were not found to be vulnerable by the
  detection script, but I'd rather not carry the bad m4 files in our sources.
  Here's a test script for anyone wanting to try it:
  if hexdump -ve '1/1 "%.2x"' /lib*/liblzma.so.5 | grep -q f30f1efa554889f54c89ce5389fb81e7000000804883ec28488954241848894c2410 ; then
    echo probably vulnerable
  else
    echo probably not vulnerable

e/emacs-29.3-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Emacs 29.3 is an emergency bugfix release intended to fix several security
  vulnerabilities described below:
  Arbitrary Lisp code is no longer evaluated as part of turning on Org mode.
  This is for security reasons, to avoid evaluating malicious Lisp code.
  New buffer-local variable 'untrusted-content'. When this is non-nil, Lisp
  programs should treat buffer contents with extra caution.
  Gnus now treats inline MIME contents as untrusted. To get back previous
  insecure behavior, 'untrusted-content' should be reset to nil in the buffer.
  LaTeX preview is now by default disabled for email attachments. To get back
  previous insecure behavior, set the variable 'org--latex-preview-when-risky'
  to a non-nil value.
  Org mode now considers contents of remote files to be untrusted.
  Remote files are recognized by calling 'file-remote-p'.

  bundled libexpat was updated to 2.6.0.

  tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup no longer dereferences symlinks when
  working around file system permission errors.

n/wpa_supplicant-2.10-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched the implementation of PEAP in wpa_supplicant to prevent an
  authentication bypass. For a successful attack, wpa_supplicant must be
  configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1
  authentication, and an eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability can then be abused
  to skip Phase 2 authentication. The attack vector is sending an EAP-TLV
  Success packet instead of starting Phase 2. This allows an adversary to
  impersonate Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.

  Compiled with support for pdumper and native compilation.
  The emacs-no-x11 binary has been dropped from the package because when
  pdumper is used the support files need to be matched to a specific binary.
  If you need a non-X console version of Emacs (or just want to reduce the
  footprint) a traditional build is available in /extra.
  Thanks to drgibbon who requested this long ago. :-)

n/bind-9.18.24-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes bugs and security issues:
  Specific DNS answers could cause a denial-of-service condition due to DNS
  validation taking a long time.
  Restore DNS64 state when handling a serve-stale timeout.
  Specific queries could trigger an assertion check with nxdomain-redirect
  enabled.
  Speed up parsing of DNS messages with many different names.

  Fixed a bug in the ICCBased color space parser that was allowing the number
  of components to be zero. Thanks to huckleberry for the bug report.
  Added checks for PDF object loops in AcroForm::scanField(),
  Catalog::readPageLabelTree2(), and Catalog::readEmbeddedFileTree().
  The zero-width character problem can also happen if the page size is very
  large -- that needs to be limited too, the same way as character position
  coordinates. Thanks to jlinliu for the bug report.
  Add some missing bounds check code in DCTStream. Thanks to Jiahao Liu for
  the bug report.
  Fix a deadlock when an object stream's length field is contained in another
  object stream. Thanks to Jiahao Liu for the bug report.

  sendmail through 8.17.2 allows SMTP smuggling in certain configurations.
  Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail
  messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF
  protection mechanism. This occurs because sendmail supports <LF>.<CR><LF>
  but some other popular e-mail servers do not. This is resolved in 8.18 and
  later versions with 'o' in srv_features.

  This update fixes possible denial-of-service security issues:
  A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from
  an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be
  NULL, but OpenSSL did not correctly check for this case. A fix has been
  applied to prevent a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL
  crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source
  using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this
  issue prior to this fix.
  OpenSSL APIs that were vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
  PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
  and PKCS12_newpass().
  When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,
  a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
  For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
  computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
  then this computation would take a long time.
  An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key
  obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
  attack.
  The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
  functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
  application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
  with the "-pubin" and "-check" options on untrusted data.
  To resolve this issue RSA keys larger than OPENSSL_RSA_MAX_MODULUS_BITS will
  now fail the check immediately with an RSA_R_MODULUS_TOO_LARGE error reason.
  Fix excessive time spent in DH check / generation with large Q parameter
  value.
  Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate an
  X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use
  DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
  to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
  Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
  an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

  Security (inbound SMTP smuggling): with "smtpd_forbid_bare_newline
  = normalize" (default "no" for Postfix < 3.9), the Postfix
  SMTP server requires the standard End-of-DATA sequence
  <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>, and otherwise allows command or message
  content lines ending in the non-standard <LF>, processing
  them as if the client sent the standard <CR><LF>.
  The alternative setting, "smtpd_forbid_bare_newline = reject"
  will reject any command or message that contains a bare
  <LF>, and is more likely to cause problems with legitimate
  clients.
  For backwards compatibility, local clients are excluded by
  default with "smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_exclusions =
  $mynetworks".

  Security: this release adds support to defend against an email spoofing
  attack (SMTP smuggling) on recipients at a Postfix server. Sites
  concerned about SMTP smuggling attacks should enable this feature on
  Internet-facing Postfix servers. For compatibility with non-standard
  clients, Postfix by default excludes clients in mynetworks from this
  countermeasure.
  The recommended settings are:
    # Optionally disconnect remote SMTP clients that send bare newlines,
    # but allow local clients with non-standard SMTP implementations
    # such as netcat, fax machines, or load balancer health checks.
    #
    smtpd_forbid_bare_newline = yes
    smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_exclusions = $mynetworks
  The smtpd_forbid_bare_newline feature is disabled by default.
  For more information, see:
    https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html

We've gone ahead and moved the 6.6 kernel into the main tree. As previously
mentioned when this branch first appeared in /testing, on the 32-bit side
there are no longer any -smp labeled kernel packages, so if you were using
those previously, you'll need to switch to using to kernel-generic or
kernel-huge kernel, including the changes needed to your bootloader setup to
load this instead of the -smp labeled kernel. Also, if you happen to be using
a first generation Pentium M chip, you will need to append forcepae to your
kernel command-line options. Enjoy! :-)

  Hey folks, I'm in need of a bit of assistance here. I've had libxml2 on the
  back burner for quite some time now in spite of yet-another variation of
  the old "billion laughs" resource exhaustion attack that's been supposedly
  fixed. The issue I'm running into with newer versions of libxml2 is that
  the rewrite rules for mapping external entities to files on the system no
  longer work, and I'm not sure why that is. For a quick demonstration,
  upgrade to this libxml2 package and then try to build glib2. You'll see
  xsltproc called to generate documentation such as the man pages, but it isn't
  able to find the entity locally and fails due to --nonet.
  I'll be keeping an eye on LQ if anyone has any hints. Thanks!

  From the release announcement:
  Pay attention to the following warning:
  This version removes a big number of utilities that have suffered from lack
  of maintenance over the years and were the source of various reported
  security issues. See "Removed functionality" below for the list of removed
  utilities. Starting with libtiff v4.6.0, their source code, at this time,
  will still be available in the source distribution, but they will no longer
  be built by default, and issues related to them will no longer be accepted
  in the libtiff bug tracker. The only remaining supported TIFF tools are
  tiffinfo, tiffdump, tiffcp, tiffset and tiffsplit.
  Shared library .so-version bump.

  This is a security release in order to address the following defect:
  An information leak vulnerability was discovered in Samba's LDAP server.
  Due to missing access control checks, an authenticated but unprivileged
  attacker could discover the names and preserved attributes of deleted objects
  in the LDAP store. Upgrading to this package will not prevent this
  information leak - if you are using Samba as an Active Directory Domain
  Controller, you will need to follow the instructions in the samba.org link
  given below.

We have fresh 6.6 kernels in /testing! You may notice that on the 32-bit side
we have done away with the -smp labeled kernel packages, but it's actually the
other kernels that were retired -- the non-SMP, non-PAE ones. If you were
previously using kernel-generic-smp or kernel-huge-smp, you'll need to make
some adjustments to your bootloader setup to load kernel-generic or kernel-huge
instead. About the only non-obsolete CPUs that may have an issue with this are
the first generation Pentium M chips, which supported PAE but unfortunately did
not advertise this in the CPU flags. But these will support PAE if the kernel
option "forcepae" is appended at boot time. Enjoy! :-)

ap/sudo-1.9.15-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  The sudoers plugin has been modified to make it more resilient to ROWHAMMER
  attacks on authentication and policy matching.
  The sudoers plugin now constructs the user time stamp file path name using
  the user-ID instead of the user name. This avoids a potential problem with
  user names that contain a path separator ('/') being interpreted as part of
  the path name.
  For more information, see:

  Don't go automatically chowning files in /var/named, since some users may
  have special requirements. But in case anyone finds that behavior useful,
  you may set NAMED_CHOWN=YES in /etc/default/named to turn it back on.
  Unless anyone has a good objection to it, this change is considered pending
  for the next BIND upgrades in -stable.
  Thanks to Mig21.

  Hey folks, if you've been following LQ you know I've talked before about
  dropping the huge kernel and moving the distribution to use only the generic
  kernel plus an initrd. After mulling this over for a few months, I think I
  was looking at the problem in the wrong way. First of all, it's clear that
  some Slackware users have been using the huge kernel all along, without an
  initrd, and are (to say the least) unhappy about the prospect of a new
  requirement to start using one. I've been recommending the generic kernel for
  some time, and a major reason is that we've been using the same set of kernel
  modules with two slightly different kernels. Because of this, there have
  always been a few (generally seldom used) kernel modules that won't load into
  the huge kernel. These are things that aren't built into the huge kernel, but
  because of a difference in some kernel module dependency, they won't load.
  The conclusion that I've come to here is that rather than drop the huge
  kernel, or slap a LOCALVERSION on it and provide a whole duplicate tree of
  kernel modules especially for the huge kernel, it would be better to make the
  generic kernel more huge, and minimize the differences between the two kernel
  configs.
  That's what I've done here.
  Shown below are the differences between the previous generic kernel config
  and the one shipping in this update. You'll notice that most of the popular
  filesystems are built in. At this point the main difference it that the huge
  kernel has a couple of dozen SCSI drivers built into it. The modules for those
  drivers won't load into the huge kernel, but they're fully built in so that
  doesn't matter. If you find any other modules that will not load into the huge
  kernel, please make a note about it on LQ and I'll see what can be done.
  So, tl;dr - what does this change mean?
  Unless your root device is on SCSI, if you were able to use the huge kernel
  without an initrd previously, you should now be able to use the generic
  kernel without an initrd. The kernel is a bit bigger, but we probably have
  enough RAM these days that it won't make a difference.
  Enjoy! :-)

  It's time for KStars in Slackware to be less of a toy and more of a useful
  tool. The required dependencies have been added for EKOS, the INDI client
  included in KStars, which will allow for computer control of astronomy
  devices. Additional deps and drivers may be required, but these are runtime
  dependencies. See (for example) gpsd, libdc1394, libftdi1, libindi-libraries,
  and libindi-drivers, all of which can be found on slackbuilds.org.
  Huge thanks to Edward W. Koenig for the detailed writeup - it was extremely

a/util-linux-2.39.2-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Copy /etc/pam.d/login to /etc/pam.d/remote. This is needed for /bin/login's
  '-h' option, used (for example) by telnetd. If -h is used without
  /etc/pam.d/remote, pam will not be configured properly, and /etc/securetty
  will be ignored, possibly allowing root to login from a tty that is not
  considered secure. Of course, the usual disclaimers about the security of
  telnet/telnetd apply.
  Thanks to HytronBG and Petri Kaukasoina.

l/libcaca-0.99.beta20-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixed a crash bug (a crafted file defining width of zero leads to divide by
  zero and a crash). Seems to be merely a bug rather than a security issue, but
  I'd been meaning to get beta20 building so this was a good excuse.
  Thanks to marav.

n/samba-4.19.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a security release in order to address the following defects:
  Unsanitized pipe names allow SMB clients to connect as root to existing
  unix domain sockets on the file system.
  SMB client can truncate files to 0 bytes by opening files with OVERWRITE
  disposition when using the acl_xattr Samba VFS module with the smb.conf
  setting "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes"
  An RODC and a user with the GET_CHANGES right can view all attributes,
  including secrets and passwords. Additionally, the access check fails
  open on error conditions.
  Calls to the rpcecho server on the AD DC can request that the server block
  for a user-defined amount of time, denying service.
  Samba can be made to start multiple incompatible RPC listeners, disrupting
  service on the AD DC.

  It appears that mesa-23.2.0 was pulled and replaced with mesa-23.2.0-rc2
  sometime after we upgraded to it. I've tested this version and it does not
  suffer from the "radeon: failed testing IB on GFX ring" bug that was
  happening with mesa-23.1.3, so let's use it for now.

  Don't support AVX2 instructions for wc. Since it's possible to enable a
  kernel option that causes the kernel to advertise AVX2 as available, but
  leads to an illegal instruction if there's an attempt to actually use
  AVX2 when old microcode is in use, this isn't reliable. Furthermore, wc
  is used by the pkgtools and this sort of failure could lead to corruption
  of the filesystem and/or package database. So, we'll disable this to be on
  the safe side. Thanks to lancsuk for noticing this issue.

Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger for these added python packages to implement
PEP 427 and PEP 517! Python modules are phasing out setup.py in favor of
building wheels, and then using python-installer to install them. These
are the bits needed to make that happen.

  AMD microcode updated to fix a use-after-free in AMD Zen2 processors.
  From Tavis Ormandy's annoucement of the issue:
    "The practical result here is that you can spy on the registers of other
    processes. No system calls or privileges are required.
    It works across virtual machines and affects all operating systems.
    I have written a poc for this issue that's fast enough to reconstruct
    keys and passwords as users log in."

n/dhcpcd-10.0.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
n/openssh-9.3p2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue:
  ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between and 5.5 and 9.3p1 (inclusive): remote code
  execution relating to PKCS#11 providers.
  The PKCS#11 support ssh-agent(1) could be abused to achieve remote code
  execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following conditions are met:
  * Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on the victim
    system.
  * Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded to an
    attacker-controlled system.
  Exploitation can also be prevented by starting ssh-agent(1) with an empty
  PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P '') or by configuring an allowlist that
  contains only specific provider libraries.
  This vulnerability was discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable by the
  Qualys Security Advisory team.
  Potentially-incompatible changes:
  * ssh-agent(8): the agent will now refuse requests to load PKCS#11 modules
  issued by remote clients by default. A flag has been added to restore the
  previous behaviour: "-Oallow-remote-pkcs11".

n/samba-4.18.5-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  When winbind is used for NTLM authentication, a maliciously crafted request
  can trigger an out-of-bounds read in winbind and possibly crash it.
  SMB2 packet signing is not enforced if an admin configured
  "server signing = required" or for SMB2 connections to Domain Controllers
  where SMB2 packet signing is mandatory.
  An infinite loop bug in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight can be
  triggered by an unauthenticated attacker by issuing a malformed RPC request.
  Missing type validation in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight can be
  used by an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a process crash in a shared
  RPC mdssvc worker process.
  As part of the Spotlight protocol Samba discloses the server-side absolute
  path of shares and files and directories in search results.

x/mesa-23.2.0_rc1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  OK, usually I won't use rc versions even in -current, but in this case I'm
  going to. Some time ago my desktop machine with RS880 / Radeon HD 4290
  graphics on the motherboard began acting up with the screen going black
  for a few seconds before returning. This after an hour or so of uptime,
  usually, then becoming more frequent with more uptime. Eventually I'd lose
  mouse and/or keyboard too, and have to reboot. Here's a couple of errors
  from dmesg:
    [ 9942.677675] [drm:r600_ib_test [radeon]] *ERROR* radeon: fence wait
                   timed out.
    [ 9942.677741] [drm:radeon_ib_ring_tests [radeon]] *ERROR* radeon: failed
                   testing IB on GFX ring (-110).
  I also noticed that the backtrace started with ttm_bo_release, and seeing
  this in recent kernel patches had been chalking this up to a kernel bug.
  I *still* think it could be, and there are a bunch of kernel patches coming
  soon to -stable from Alex Deucher that could address the underlying causes
  (not for 6.1.39 though, unfortunately). Anyway, I'd recently figured out
  that reverting Mesa sufficiently made the issue go away. And now it seems
  this 23.2.0 release candidate also fixes the issue.
  Yes, I could go search for the commits to cherry-pick, but we'll be moving
  to mesa-23.2.0 when it's released, so we might as well start testing now.

Hey folks! It's time to acknowledge another one of those milestones... 30 (!)
years since I made the post linked below announcing Slackware's first stable
release after months of beta testing. Thanks to all of our dedicated
contributors, loyal users, and those who have helped us to keep the lights on
here. It's really been a remarkable journey that I couldn't have anticipated
starting out back in 1993. Cheers! :-)

  When building the package, install from the download directory rather than
  moving the download directory to the destination directory first. Evidently
  "cp -d foo foo" and "cat foo > foo" don't exactly behave the same. ;-)
  Support a COMPRESSION= variable which may be set to xz or zstd to compress
  the kernel modules. For now, we'll stick with uncompressed modules.

  This fixes a rare divide-by-zero bug that could cause vim to crash. In an
  interactive program such as vim, I can't really see this qualifying as a
  security issue, but since it was brought up as such on LQ we'll just go
  along with it this time. :)
  Thanks to marav for the heads-up.

  This update fixes a security issue.
  Qt-based clients may mismatch HSTS headers (Strict-Transport-Security),
  which would prevent the client from switching to a secure HTTPS
  connection as requested by a server.

t/texlive-2023.230322-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This update patches a security issue:
  LuaTeX before 1.17.0 allows execution of arbitrary shell commands when
  compiling a TeX file obtained from an untrusted source. This occurs
  because luatex-core.lua lets the original io.popen be accessed. This also
  affects TeX Live before 2023 r66984 and MiKTeX before 23.5.
  Thanks to Johannes Schoepfer.

  [PATCH] Merge pull request from GHSA-gpxc-v2m8-fr3x.
  With execv() command line arguments are passed as separate strings and
  not the full command line in a single string. This prevents arbitrary
  command execution by escaping the quoting of the arguments in a job
  with forged job title.
  Thanks to marav.

d/git-2.40.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  By feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a
  path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially
  controlled contents (corresponding to the rejected hunk(s) from
  the given patch).
  When Git is compiled with runtime prefix support and runs without
  translated messages, it still used the gettext machinery to
  display messages, which subsequently potentially looked for
  translated messages in unexpected places. This allowed for
  malicious placement of crafted messages.
  When renaming or deleting a section from a configuration file,
  certain malicious configuration values may be misinterpreted as
  the beginning of a new configuration section, leading to arbitrary
  configuration injection.

  This update fixes security issues:
  An incomplete access check on dnsHostName allows authenticated but otherwise
  unprivileged users to delete this attribute from any object in the directory.
  The Samba AD DC administration tool, when operating against a remote LDAP
  server, will by default send new or reset passwords over a signed-only
  connection.
  The fix in 4.6.16, 4.7.9, 4.8.4 and 4.9.7 for CVE-2018-10919 Confidential
  attribute disclosure via LDAP filters was insufficient and an attacker may
  be able to obtain confidential BitLocker recovery keys from a Samba AD DC.
  Installations with such secrets in their Samba AD should assume they have
  been obtained and need replacing.

  Don't link with OpenSSL's libcrypto, as it creates problems on machines that
  don't yet have openssl3 installed when /bin/sort suddenly depends upon
  libcrypto.so.3. Worked fine without this previously, so it shouldn't really
  make any difference. There's also a configure option to use the kernel's
  crypto routines if available, but for now we'll skip this.

modules, and vsftpd. I think nobody cares about trying to force python2 to use
openssl3... it's EOL but still a zombie, unfortunately. I have seen some
patches for vsftpd and intend to take a look at them. We've bumped PHP to 8.2
and just gone ahead and killed 8.0 and 8.1. Like 7.4, 8.0 is not compatible
with openssl3 and it doesn't seem worthwhile to try to patch it. And with 8.2
already out for several revisions, 8.1 does not seem particularly valuable.
If you make use of PHP you should be used to it being a moving target by now.
Enjoy, and let me know if anything isn't working right. Cheers!

d/git-2.39.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  Using a specially-crafted repository, Git can be tricked into using
  its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport.
  Though Git will abort local clones whose source $GIT_DIR/objects
  directory contains symbolic links (c.f., CVE-2022-39253), the objects
  directory itself may still be a symbolic link.
  These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known
  paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's
  working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as
  CVE-2022-39253.
  By feeding a crafted input to "git apply", a path outside the
  working tree can be overwritten as the user who is running "git
  apply".

n/curl-7.88.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  [PATCH] Account for grouping in printf width (bug 23432).
  This issue could cause a overflow with sprintf in the corner case where an
  application computes the size of buffer to be exactly enough to fit the
  digits in question, but sprintf ends up writing a couple of extra bytes.
  Thanks to marav for the heads-up.

testing/packages/samba-4.17.5-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Build with the bundled Heimdal instead of the system MIT Kerberos, since MIT
  Kerberos has more issues when Samba is used as an AD DC. I'd appreciate any
  feedback on the "Samba on Slackware 15" thread on LQ about how well this
  works. Although it's not the sort of change I'd normally make in a -stable
  release such as Slackware 15.0, in this case I'm considering it if it can
  be done painlessly for any existing users... but I'll need to see some
  reports about this. I'd like to note that yes, of course we saw the
  "experimental" label in the configure flag we used to build Samba, but we
  also saw another prominent Linux distribution go ahead and use it anyway. :)
  And the Samba package built against MIT Kerberos cooked in the previous
  -current development cycle for a couple of years without any objections.
  Anyway, hopefully we'll get some testing from folks out there with networks
  that use AD and go from there.
  Thanks to Rowland Penny of the Samba team for clarifying this situation.

  This release contains fixes for two security problems and a memory safety
  problem. The memory safety problem is not believed to be exploitable, but
  upstream reports most network-reachable memory faults as security bugs.

  This update fixes bugs and the following security issues:
  An UPDATE message flood could cause :iscman:`named` to exhaust all
  available memory. This flaw was addressed by adding a new
  :any:`update-quota` option that controls the maximum number of
  outstanding DNS UPDATE messages that :iscman:`named` can hold in a
  queue at any given time (default: 100).
  :iscman:`named` could crash with an assertion failure when an RRSIG
  query was received and :any:`stale-answer-client-timeout` was set to a
  non-zero value. This has been fixed.
  :iscman:`named` running as a resolver with the
  :any:`stale-answer-client-timeout` option set to any value greater
  than ``0`` could crash with an assertion failure, when the
  :any:`recursive-clients` soft quota was reached. This has been fixed.

We're going to go ahead and jump to the 6.1.4 kernel, in spite of the fact
that a kernel bisect identified the patch that was preventing 32-bit from
booting here on a Thinkpad X1E:

------
From 2e479b3b82c49bfb9422274c0a9c155a41caecb7 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Michael Kelley <mikelley@microsoft.com>
Date: Wed, 16 Nov 2022 10:41:24 -0800
Subject: [PATCH] x86/ioremap: Fix page aligned size calculation in
 __ioremap_caller()

commit 4dbd6a3e90e03130973688fd79e19425f720d999 upstream.

Current code re-calculates the size after aligning the starting and
ending physical addresses on a page boundary. But the re-calculation
also embeds the masking of high order bits that exceed the size of
the physical address space (via PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK). If the masking
removes any high order bits, the size calculation results in a huge
value that is likely to immediately fail.

Fix this by re-calculating the page-aligned size first. Then mask any
high order bits using PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK.

Fixes: ffa71f33a820 ("x86, ioremap: Fix incorrect physical address handling in
PAE mode")
------

The non-SMP non-PAE 32-bit kernel is fine even without the patch revert.
The PAE kernel also works fine with this patch reverted without any need
to revert ffa71f33a820 (the patch that this one is supposed to fix). The
machine's excessive (for 32-bit) amount of physical RAM (64GB) might also
be a factor here considering the PAE kernel works on all the other machines
around here without reverting this patch.
The patch is reverted only on 32-bit. Upstream report still pending.
Enjoy! :-)

Hey folks, Merry Christmas and Hanukkah Sameach! Figured it was about time to
get some kind of kernel activity going again, but it most definitely belongs
in /testing for now. I've been trying to shape this up for weeks, but there
are still issues, and maybe someone out there can help. The biggest problem
is that the 32-bit kernels crash on boot. Initially there's some sort of
Intel ME failure (this is on a Thinkpad X1E). If those modules are
blacklisted, then the kernel will go on to crash loading the snd_hda_intel
module. The other issue is that I've got a 4K panel in this machine, and
have always appended the kernel option video=1920x1080@60 to put the console
in HD instead, and then loaded a Terminus console font to make the text even
larger. With these kernels, that option is completely ignored. I've tried some
other syntax I've seen online to no avail. And when the Terminus font is
loaded the text gets *even smaller* for some reason.
So be careful of these kernels (especially the 32-bit ones), but I welcome
any hints about what's going on here or if there are config changes that
might get this working properly. Is anyone out there running a 6.x kernel on
bare metal 32-bit x86?
Cheers!

a/sysvinit-scripts-15.1-noarch-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  rc.6: support an optional rc.firewall_shutdown script. Most firewall scripts
  don't need a formal shutdown, but in some cases it can be useful. If your
  rc.firewall script supports a stop parameter, the shutdown script should just
  contain "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall stop", or rc.firewall_shutdown could also be
  a symlink to the rc.firewall script in that case. But how the script works
  is (like the rc.firewall script support) completely up to the admin.
  Thanks to metaed for the suggestion.
  Please note that contrary to the request, I placed this *after* the network
  is shut down to avoid removing firewall protection while the interfaces are
  still active. Whether it'll work in this place for metaed's (or anyone
  else's) needs, I'm not sure. It's a start. Feel free to weigh in on the LQ
  thread if you have any ideas for improvement, but the goal here is to keep
  this support as simple and flexible as possible.

  This update fixes security issues:
  This is the Samba CVE for the Windows Kerberos RC4-HMAC Elevation of
  Privilege Vulnerability disclosed by Microsoft on Nov 8 2022.
  A Samba Active Directory DC will issue weak rc4-hmac session keys for
  use between modern clients and servers despite all modern Kerberos
  implementations supporting the aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 cipher.
  On Samba Active Directory DCs and members
  'kerberos encryption types = legacy'
  would force rc4-hmac as a client even if the server supports
  aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 and/or aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96.
  This is the Samba CVE for the Windows Kerberos Elevation of Privilege
  Vulnerability disclosed by Microsoft on Nov 8 2022.
  A service account with the special constrained delegation permission
  could forge a more powerful ticket than the one it was presented with.
  The "RC4" protection of the NetLogon Secure channel uses the same
  algorithms as rc4-hmac cryptography in Kerberos, and so must also be
  assumed to be weak.
  Note that there are several important behavior changes included in this
  release, which may cause compatibility problems interacting with system
  still expecting the former behavior.

  CVE-2022-38023 carefully!

  Starting this out in /testing for now, since I've been trying for 2 days to
  get it to compile on 32-bit with no luck. It ends up failing with a bunch of
  errors like this:
  ld.lld: error: undefined hidden symbol: tabs_4d51_TabsStore_sync
  Any help getting this to build on 32-bit would be greatly appreciated.
  I've tried most of ponce's bag of tricks already. :-)

e/emacs-28.2-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell
  metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c
  uses the system C library function in its implementation of the ctags
  program. For example, a victim may use the "ctags *" command (suggested in
  the ctags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory
  has contents that depend on untrusted input.

  This update fixes security issues:
  gh-98739: Updated bundled libexpat to 2.5.0 to fix CVE-2022-43680
  (heap use-after-free).
  gh-98433: The IDNA codec decoder used on DNS hostnames by socket or asyncio
  related name resolution functions no longer involves a quadratic algorithm
  to fix CVE-2022-45061. This prevents a potential CPU denial of service if an
  out-of-spec excessive length hostname involving bidirectional characters were
  decoded. Some protocols such as urllib http 3xx redirects potentially allow
  for an attacker to supply such a name.
  gh-100001: python -m http.server no longer allows terminal control characters
  sent within a garbage request to be printed to the stderr server log.
  gh-87604: Avoid publishing list of active per-interpreter audit hooks via the
  gc module.
  gh-97514: On Linux the multiprocessing module returns to using filesystem
  backed unix domain sockets for communication with the forkserver process
  instead of the Linux abstract socket namespace. Only code that chooses to use
  the "forkserver" start method is affected. This prevents Linux CVE-2022-42919
  (potential privilege escalation) as abstract sockets have no permissions and
  could allow any user on the system in the same network namespace (often the
  whole system) to inject code into the multiprocessing forkserver process.
  Filesystem based socket permissions restrict this to the forkserver process
  user as was the default in Python 3.8 and earlier.
  gh-98517: Port XKCP's fix for the buffer overflows in SHA-3 to fix
  CVE-2022-37454.
  gh-68966: The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject unsafe text
  (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into shell commands to address
  CVE-2015-20107. Instead of using such text, it will warn and act as if a
  match was not found (or for test commands, as if the test failed).

ap/sysstat-12.7.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  On 32 bit systems, in versions 9.1.16 and newer but prior to 12.7.1,
  allocate_structures contains a size_t overflow in sa_common.c. The
  allocate_structures function insufficiently checks bounds before arithmetic
  multiplication, allowing for an overflow in the size allocated for the
  buffer representing system activities.
  This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

  This release fixes two security issues:
  * CVE-2022-39253:
  When relying on the `--local` clone optimization, Git dereferences
  symbolic links in the source repository before creating hardlinks
  (or copies) of the dereferenced link in the destination repository.
  This can lead to surprising behavior where arbitrary files are
  present in a repository's `$GIT_DIR` when cloning from a malicious
  repository.
  Git will no longer dereference symbolic links via the `--local`
  clone mechanism, and will instead refuse to clone repositories that
  have symbolic links present in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory.
  Additionally, the value of `protocol.file.allow` is changed to be
  "user" by default.
  * CVE-2022-39260:
  An overly-long command string given to `git shell` can result in
  overflow in `split_cmdline()`, leading to arbitrary heap writes and
  remote code execution when `git shell` is exposed and the directory
  `$HOME/git-shell-commands` exists.
  `git shell` is taught to refuse interactive commands that are
  longer than 4MiB in size. `split_cmdline()` is hardened to reject
  inputs larger than 2GiB.

ap/vim-9.0.0594-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixed stack-based buffer overflow.
  Thanks to marav for the heads-up.
  In addition, Mig21 pointed out an issue where the defaults.vim file might
  need to be edited for some purposes as its contents will override the
  settings in the system-wide vimrc. Usually this file is replaced whenever
  vim is upgraded, which in those situations would be inconvenient for the
  admin. So, I've added support for a file named defaults.vim.custom which
  (if it exists) will be used instead of the defaults.vim file shipped in
  the package and will persist through upgrades.

  Fix memory leak in EdDSA verify processing.
  Fix serve-stale crash that could happen when stale-answer-client-timeout
  was set to 0 and there was a stale CNAME in the cache for an incoming query.
  Fix memory leaks in the DH code when using OpenSSL 3.0.0 and later versions.
  The openssldh_compare(), openssldh_paramcompare(), and openssldh_todns()
  functions were affected.
  When an HTTP connection was reused to get statistics from the stats channel,
  and zlib compression was in use, each successive response sent larger and
  larger blocks of memory, potentially reading past the end of the allocated
  buffer.
  Prevent excessive resource use while processing large delegations.

a/grep-3.8-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Folks, I rarely veto upstream, but I'm not going to entertain this nonsense.
  The egrep and fgrep commands were part of Unix since the 70s, continue to be
  included with the BSDs, and frankly, aren't hurting anything. GNU grep
  declared them deprecated in 2007 and when they were changed into shell
  scripts around 8 years ago I figured that's where it would end. I can see no
  logical justification to have these scripts start making noise and then to
  eventually pull the rug out from under any code that might be using them, so
  I've placed non-noisy versions of them into the package sources and will be
  installing those during the build. Given that the -F and -E options are part
  of the POSIX standard, these scripts will continue to work fine. That said,
  we will be continuing to change our own code over to the recommended syntax
  to avoid the minimal overhead incurred compared to using grep directly.

  gh-95778: Converting between int and str in bases other than 2 (binary), 4,
  8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base 10 (decimal) now raises a
  ValueError if the number of digits in string form is above a limit to avoid
  potential denial of service attacks due to the algorithmic complexity.

  Applied all post-release patches from the 2.36 branch.
  This fixes a security issue introduced in glibc-2.36: When the syslog
  function is passed a crafted input string larger than 1024 bytes, it
  reads uninitialized memory from the heap and prints it to the target log
  file, potentially revealing a portion of the contents of the heap.
  Thanks to marav.
  The patches also help with several packages failing to build from source.

  Patched sendmail.h to fix SASL auth. Thanks to af7567.
  Build without -DUSE_EAI (which is evidently considered experimental) since
  the option breaks the vacation binary. Thanks to bitfuzzy and HQuest.
  It is possible that this could work but requires additional options. I found
  this in the ChangeLog for the SUSE rpm:
    Experimental support for SMTPUTF8 (EAI, see RFC 6530-6533) is available
    when using the compile time option USE_EAI (see also
    devtools/Site/site.config.m4.sample for other required settings) and the cf
    option SMTPUTF8.  If a mail submission via the command line requires the
    use of SMTPUTF8, e.g., because a header uses UTF-8 encoding, but the
    addresses on the command line are all ASCII, then the new option -U must be
    used, and the cf option SMTPUTF8 must be set in submit.cf.
  Any assistance with getting -DUSE_EAI working properly would be appreciated.

extra/sendmail/sendmail-8.17.1-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In recent versions of glibc, USE_INET6 has been removed which caused sendmail
  to reject mail from IPv6 addresses. Adding -DHAS_GETHOSTBYNAME2=1 to the
  site.config.m4 allows the reverse lookups to work again fixing this issue.
  Thanks to talo.

  Rebuilt with a patch from Arch to reenable DT_HASH in shared objects since
  the change broke Steam games that use EPIC's EAC. I'm not exactly 100% on
  board with this approach, but since DT_GNU_HASH remains and is still used,
  I guess I'll go along with it for now. Hopefully EAC will be patched and we
  can back this out.
  Thanks to Swaggajackin for the notice and for providing links to the glibc
  bug discussion as well as the patch.
  If anything else needs a rebuild after this, let me know in the LQ thread.

n/rsync-3.2.5-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Added some file-list safety checking that helps to ensure that a rogue
  sending rsync can't add unrequested top-level names and/or include recursive
  names that should have been excluded by the sender. These extra safety
  checks only require the receiver rsync to be updated. When dealing with an
  untrusted sending host, it is safest to copy into a dedicated destination
  directory for the remote content (i.e. don't copy into a destination
  directory that contains files that aren't from the remote host unless you
  trust the remote host).

Hey folks, here's that graphics stack upgrade that you've been waiting for!
After looking at what drivers are currently shipped by other projects, I took
an axe to the driver list. Some of the removed drivers will still compile even
though they are abandoned, and some of the others are still getting git commits
(which allows *some* of them to compile). The removed stuff mostly looks
obsolete to me (we really can't support ancient hardware forever). But if you
think I've gone too far with any of these removals, please make or contribute
to a thread about it on LQ and I'll take any comments there into consideration.

  Since Samba still won't link against krb5-1.20, I think it's best to drop
  back to this version until it does. Perhaps it would be better to just use
  the internal Heimdal libraries instead, but I don't really know if that has
  all the same functionality or not. Hints welcome if you'd like to drop them
  in the "regression on -current with samba (new krb5)" thread.
  Also, just to be 100% sure the krb5 revert doesn't cause any ABI issues,
  we'll recompile everything that we've linked to krb5 while krb5-1.20 was
  in -current.
  Thanks to nobodino.

  In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in
  CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not
  properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were
  found by code review.
  When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there
  are other places in the script where the file names of certificates
  being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell.

a/aaa_libraries-15.1-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Upgraded: libz.so.1.2.12, libexpat.so.1.8.8, libcap.so.2.64,
  libicudata.so.70.1, libicui18n.so.70.1, libicuio.so.70.1,
  libicutest.so.70.1, libicutu.so.70.1, libicuuc.so.70.1.
  The icu4c libraries are from the previous package (for temporary
  compatibility) and will be removed in a month or so.
  Removed: liblber-2.4.so.2.11.7, libldap-2.4.so.2.11.7.
a/haveged-1.9.18-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  I've decided to turn this back on by default in light of comments in
  README.md. It doesn't hurt to have an additional source of entropy
  (especially in early boot), and the overhead from running this daemon is
  negligible.
a/sysvinit-scripts-15.0-noarch-11.txz:  Rebuilt.
  rc.S, rc.6: use a temporary umask and more syncing to avoid any races when
  creating the random seed directory and files. Use the poolsize rather than
  a hardcoded 512 bytes when creating a non-creditable seed in the fallback
  scripts. Thanks to Jason A. Donenfeld.

a/haveged-1.9.17-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Install /etc/rc.d/rc.haveged as non-executable. For existing installations
  running a recent kernel, it is safe to turn this off.
  Back when we added the haveged package we were using the 4.4 kernel, but
  since Linux 5.4 this same entropy generating algorithm has been built into
  the kernel, so there's no reason to also run it in userspace. We'll keep
  the package around (for now, anyway) in case someone might be running an
  old kernel. Thanks to Jason A. Donenfeld.
a/sysvinit-scripts-15.0-noarch-10.txz:  Rebuilt.
  rc.S, rc.6: use the seedrng utility to seed and initialize the kernel
  random number generator and generate a new seed.
  If seedrng is missing, we'll attempt to do these things with scripting.
  Thanks to Jason A. Donenfeld for hints about how to make a modest
  improvement in that regard (blame me for any problems with my own changes),
  but because you can't force the kernel RNG to initialize with a script
  (it needs an ioctl), you won't get the same guarantees that you do when
  using the new seedrng utility.
a/util-linux-2.38-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added seedrng utility, used to seed and initialize the kernel random number
  generator and to generate new seeds for carrying entropy across reboots.

  This update fixes bugs and the following security issues:
  An assertion could occur in resume_dslookup() if the fetch had been shut
  down earlier.
  Lookups involving a DNAME could trigger an INSIST when "synth-from-dnssec"
  was enabled.
  A synchronous call to closehandle_cb() caused isc__nm_process_sock_buffer()
  to be called recursively, which in turn left TCP connections hanging in the
  CLOSE_WAIT state blocking indefinitely when out-of-order processing was
  disabled.
  The rules for acceptance of records into the cache have been tightened to
  prevent the possibility of poisoning if forwarders send records outside
  the configured bailiwick.

  Perhaps upstream didn't mean to move these files (or perhaps we should have
  recompiled everything that looks for these), but they did switch to meson,
  and the 'xkb-base' option to set the data directory doesn't work. Anyway,
  I've placed a symlink at /etc/X11/xkb and that fixes the problem.
  Thanks to Petri Kaukasoina and LuckyCyborg.

Well here we are a week later... welcome back to -current with a bunch of new
updates. Had to give marav's script something to kick out. If it were April 1st
maybe I would have put a fake 15.1 release announcement here. ;-)
I'll probably take some time off eventually but there were too many updates
that I skipped during late RC, and I love doing this, so...  enjoy!

Slackware 15.0 x86_64 stable is released!

Another too-long development cycle is behind us after we bit off more than
we could chew and then had to shine it up to a high-gloss finish. Hopefully
we've managed to get the tricky parts out of the way so that we'll be able
to see a 15.1 incremental update after a far shorter development cycle.
Certainly the development infrastructure has been streamlined here and things
should be easier moving forward. My thanks to the rest of the Slackware team,
all the upstream developers who have given us such great building materials,
the folks on LinuxQuestions.org and elsewhere for all the help with testing,
great suggestions, and countless bug fixes, and to everyone who helped
support this project so that the release could finally see the light of day.
I couldn't have done any of this without your help, and I'm grateful to all
of you. Thanks!

Have fun!  :-)
