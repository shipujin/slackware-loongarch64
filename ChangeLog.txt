Slackware 13.1 x86_64 stable is released!
Lots of thanks are due -- see the RELEASE_NOTES and the rest of the
ChangeLog for credits.  The ISOs are on their way to replication,
a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided 32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.
We are taking pre-orders now at store.slackware.com, and offering 
a discount if you sign up for a subscription.  Consider picking up
a copy to help support the project.  Thanks again to the Slackware
community for testing, contributing, and generally holding us to a
high level of quality.  :-)
Enjoy!

Tue May 18 22:17:13 UTC 2010
Slackware 13.1 RC2.  Expect a stable release when it's ready.
l/system-config-printer-1.2.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
xap/pidgin-2.7.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  libpurple in Pidgin before 2.7.0 allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service (application crash) via a custom emoticon in a
  malformed SLP message.

  Merged Till Kamppeter's patch to restore the ability to use usblp with
  the USB backend (in addition to the libusb method).  This package will
  remove any cups.blacklist.usblp.conf from a previous installation.
  Thanks to Martin on linuxquestions.org for pointing out the patch.

a/mdadm-2.6.9-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  At this point it's probably best to stick with the 2.6.x branch for
  Slackware 13.1.  We will switch to the 3.x mdadm branch in the next
  devel cycle -- it's going to take some init script changes, new udev
  rules, and lots of testing.

Hi folks!  We have some pretty big changes today, with an update to the latest
KDE SC 4.4.3, and the addition of support for ConsoleKit and PolicyKit which
have been enhanced to use shadow authentication.  Thanks to Andrew Psaltis for
doing some great work on polkit-1, and to Robby Workman for spending months
following the sometimes random developments coming from the CK/PK camp.  :-)
Thanks to Eric Hameleers for leading the KDE 4.4.x Slackware development and
handling the out-of-tree testing through http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/.

  This driver supports a video chipset used only on MIPS hardware.
x/xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist-noarch-1.txz:  Added.
  This is NOT the nouveau driver!  It installs a file in /etc/modprobe.d/
  to prevent the kernel module from autoloading.  We don't want the nouveau
  loaded since we do not ship the nouveau driver (yet), and having the
  module loaded prevents the nv and binary nVidia drivers from working.
x/xf86-video-xgixp-1.7.99.4-x86_64-1.txz:  Removed.
  This driver breaks X -configure and running X.Org without a config file.

  If anyone actually uses this driver, please let us know.

n/httpd-2.2.15-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update addresses a few security issues.
  mod_ssl: A partial fix for the TLS renegotiation prefix injection attack
    by rejecting any client-initiated renegotiations.
  mod_proxy_ajp: Respond with HTTP_BAD_REQUEST when the body is not sent
    when request headers indicate a request body is incoming; not a case of
    HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.
  mod_isapi: Do not unload an isapi .dll module until the request processing
    is completed, avoiding orphaned callback pointers.
    [This is the most serious flaw, but does not affect Linux systems]

  New kernels...  and this deserves a mention/warning:  the last bits of the
  "old" IDE/ATA system have been removed now.  Everything should be using
  the libata based drivers now, so if you have any drives that are currently
  running as /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, etc., when you reboot with these kernels all
  drives will be renamed as /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.  If you had any /dev/sd*
  already, they might get renamed.  Adjustments may be required in
  /etc/lilo.conf, /etc/fstab, the initrd, and elsewhere.  Good luck!

d/ruby-1.9.1_p243-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added an explicit --enable-pthread.  This is mostly to make sure that we get
  the expected option set from future releases of Ruby -- it appears that not
  only is --enable-pthread the default in ruby-1.9.1, but trying to use
  --disable-pthread doesn't work.  Furthermore, Ruby and Tcl/Tk no longer work
  together unless both Ruby and Tcl/Tk are compiled with thread support.
  Compiling Tcl/Tk with thread support has caused some problems in the past.
  If a threaded Tcl app tries to fork(), it will hang, but by now most affected
  Tcl apps (such as eggdrop) should have patches available.
  Anyway, this should fix the issues with Ruby and Tk.  Please test it, and
  report any other problems that arise.
tcl/tcl-8.5.8-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  BIND 9.4.3-P4 is a SECURITY PATCH for BIND 9.4.3-P3.  It addresses a

xap/seamonkey-2.0-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  As of version 2.0, SeaMonkey no longer includes a shared libgtkmozembed
  library, so the pkgconfig and header files for this have been removed from
  the package to avoid confusion over why trying to compile programs that
  use it no longer works.  There's not really any way to avoid this issue --
  it's either upgrade SeaMonkey and lose libgtkmozembed, or keep using version
  1.1.18 and miss out on SeaMonkey security updates.  If you really need
  libgtkmozembed, the seamonkey-1.1.18 packages will be retained in either
  /patches or /pasture for Slackware versions 13.0 and earlier.

l/phonon-4.3.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Added.
  Phonon in Qt is missing support files needed by KDE, so this package
  restores the missing pieces.  The Phonon library, include files, and
  pkgconfig files will remain in the Qt package, as those are the most
  up-to-date versions.  This package will contain the xine and gstreamer
  backends and other files needed by KDE.  The gstreamer backend source
  is taken from the newer sources in Qt, not from the standalone Phonon.
  Sorry about the misfire last time...  this stuff should work.  :-)

  mount.cifs could allow a local user to read the first line of an arbitrary
  file if installed setuid.  (On Slackware, it was not installed setuid)
  Specially crafted SMB requests could cause a denial of service.

x/mesa-7.5.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixed install script to add glxinfo and other programs that were part
  of previous Mesa patches.  I was under the impression that these no longer
  built, and had been deprecated upstream.  Thanks to Adam Kirchhoff for
  setting me straight on that.

l/seamonkey-solibs-1.1.18-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added libnssutil3.so, as several other libraries in the package depend
  on it, and otherwise it is found only in the main seamonkey package
  (which sort of defeats the purpose of this one).
  Thanks to Grigorios Bouzakis for the bug report.
