This is a version of Rust that's closer to what Mozilla is recommending for
compiling Firefox, Seamonkey, and Thunderbird.

To see the recommended minimum and maximum versions of Rust that upstream
recommends for Firefox (or for Seamonkey/Thunderbird using the backend from the
same version of Firefox), see this link:

This version of Rust has been compiled with the bundled version of LLVM to
avoid depending on any particular version of LLVM. This may cause a warning
from ldconfig, but that's harmless.

This Rust package will be updated in place to follow the requirements for the
various Mozilla packages in the main tree (for -current), or in /patches (for
a stable release).
