Google Chrome (Open Source Web Browser)
---------------------------------------

Here's how to install Google Chrome on Slackware.


First, go to the Google Chrome site:

http://www.google.com/chrome

Click the download button, and select either:

    < >  32 bit .deb (for Debian/Ubuntu)
OR
    < >  64 bit .deb (for Debian/Ubuntu)


Read and accept the license terms, and download the .deb package.


Then, with the google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb or 
google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb package in the same directory
as the google-chrome.SlackBuild script, run the script as root to
convert the .deb to a Slackware .txz:

./google-chrome.SlackBuild

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version
of Google Chrome found in the .deb package, but it will be something
like:  google-chrome-10.0.648.151-x86_64-1.txz

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


Then, install the package (again as root):

cd /tmp
upgradepkg --install-new google-chrome-10.0.648.151-x86_64-1.txz


Finally, please note that Google Chrome requires the GConf and ORBit2
packages found in this directory in order to run.  Be careful with these
as they may create unintended dependencies on GConf/ORBit2 in other
software that you compile on machines where they are installed.

Newer beta and unstable builds may also require the PAM library libpam.so.0.
Installing the google-chrome-pam-solibs package in this directory will
allow these newer versions of Chrome to run without having to actually
switch the system to using PAM.  If you need real PAM (to compile Chromium
for example), you can find it in /extra/source/pam/.

Enjoy!  :-)
