The 'sh' completion file only completes on *.sh files.  This breaks the 
expectation (on Slackware, at least) that e.g. "sh /etc/rc.d/rc.my<TAB>" 
will complete to rc.mysql.  This patch fixes that, but a consequence is that
"sh" will complete on *any* filename.  IMHO, that's not a regression at all,
since stock bash without bash-completion does that already...  --rworkman
