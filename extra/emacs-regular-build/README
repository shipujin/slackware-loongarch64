This is an Emacs package with these features:

--with-pdumper=auto --without-native-compilation

Contains an Emacs binary supporting X11 and the GTK+3 toolkit.

This will also run in a virtual console, and can be forced to run in text mode
in an xterm or other terminal emulator by starting it with "emacs -nw".

The emacs.Slackbuild can generate several other variants of Emacs.
See the build script for details.
